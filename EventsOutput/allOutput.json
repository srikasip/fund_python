Providence, RI","description":"Take a seat and put you drinks/food in location where you're less likely to knock them over, because as soon as Corey Manning descends upon the stage... It's on!!!  If there is no energy in the room, he brings it. If there IS energy in the room, Corey absorbs it, electrifies it, and then takes it to another level.  Featured in season one of Nick Jr.âs NickMom Night Out Comedy Showcase, Corey was the Winner of the World Series of Comedy East Coast Regional Satellite Competition at Goodnights Comedy Club in July of 2011, and out of 101 comedians he finished in the Top Eight in the WSOC Finals in Las Vegas. With a resume that includes performances in Jamie Foxx's LAFFAPALOOZA's New Faces In Comedy, headlining comedy clubs nationally, and touring with comedians such as Mo'Nique, Tracey Morgan, Bill Burr, Damon Wayans, Lavell Crawford, John Witherspoon, Bill Bellamy, and Bonnie MacFarlane; Corey is known for his 'Slick, upbeat, funny, over-the-top comedy.'  Corey has yet to find an audience he can't entertain, or a topic he can't cover. From discussing culture, college life, being a NCP (non-custodial parent), the positives and negatives of social media, relationships and his experience with 'Girls Night Out', Corey can cover the most challenging topics, in a tasteful and insightful way. Although there is usually no filter or safety net to Corey's performance, upon request he can provide entertainment that is appropriate and/or can be tailored to any audiences.  So if you're ready for a laugh of a life time, call Corey Manning to your rescue. He is your Comedian By Night. Superhero = By Day.

Providence, 02914","description":"Ben Hague is a stand up comedian, TV & radio personality, writer, and one of the hottest young talents on the comedy scene today. He is also the foremost aficionado of buffalo wings, and is an overall 'good boy' according to his Nonnie.   At 21, after attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan, Ben moved to LA to pursue a career in comedy. He debuted his stand-up act at the world-famous comedy club Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, and never looked back. Since then he has been privileged to share the stage with such talents as Dane Cook, Dave Attel, Louis CK, Robert Klein, Jeffrey Ross, Gilbert Gottfried and many others.   Ben was a finalist in the Orange County 'Laff Down' (2003) and Orange County 'California's Funniest Person' two years running (2004, 2005). He won the 'Catch A 'New' Rising Star' competition in his home state of Rhode Island in 2006. Ben has headlined at comedy clubs throughout the US, over 50 colleges nationally, and performed at the prestigious Fringe Festival in Scotland in 2011.   In 2009, Ben began his move into media by winning a hosting spot on FOX Providence's 'The Rhode Show', beating out hundreds of other contestants. Ratings for the morning TV program immediately rose after he joined the team, and Ben became a staple on the show.   After his one year booking on 'The Rhode Show' ended, he was immediately signed by the top morning radio show in New England, the 'Giovanni and Kim Show' on 92.3 WPRO FM. The show is heard by over 300,000 listeners weekly. He also hosts many events and charities throughout the northeast, and of course is seen by thousands headlining on stages nationally. His debut recorded comedy album 'AVOID THE WET SPOT' is in the works for summer 2012. He currently lives in New York City and performs weekly at the top clubs in the city.   In his free time Ben enjoys all outdoor activities, is a huge new England sports fan, and can often be heard at bar's telling girls he wrote the screen plays for Mama Mia, and the Notebook.","datetime":",Fri.-Sat. 8pm","price":"","imagePath":"http://www.providenceonline.com","dump":"Register | Log in\nOutdoor Guide\nCheck out the newest issue of Hey Rhody!

Showtime is 8:00 P.M.  Tickets are $35.00.  The venue is at 59 Main St, E. Greenwich, RI.  For more information call 401-885-4000.  Please check out this wonderful live review of their recent performance in Ocean City in Atlantic City Weekly:  http://tinyurl.com/lp8cdut  The Machine has forged a 25 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own. Over the years, The Machine has touched the hearts and souls of many, selling out theaters, large clubs and casinos across North and Central America, Europe and Asia. They have also appeared at renowned music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Riverbend, Gathering of the Vibes, Buffalo's Artpark, and Germanyâs Rock of Ages.  The New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for performing a diverse mix of The Floydâs extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of popular hits as well as obscure gems), The Machineâs stellar musicianship, dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest.  In the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even rivaling that of an early 1970âs Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980âs. The band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A to Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the alphabet.  Additionally, the quartet has been sharing the stage with full symphony orchestras, including the Atlanta, Detroit, Pittsburgh and San Diego Symphonies.  In 2004, Two Nights at the Keswick was released as a DVD/CD, archiving the bandâs bi-annual residency at this historic Philadelphia venue. Their next release, Unplugged (2006) captures a special acoustic performance at B.B. Kingâs in NYC featuring rare Syd Barrett solo material and deep cuts from early Floyd albums. Live In Amsterdam, a stunning concert DVD filmed at the Pepsi Stage, was released in August of 2008.

How does society define us? How do we begin to name and define ourselves? Part 1 of this course leads participants through a series of prompts, games, and exercises centered around identity, selfhood, and power. Weâll rant and rave, question and critique, experiment and play. Part 2: Invisible Cities What if you were in charge of everything in the world? In this portion of the class, youâll design a society, community or culture and write a story about it or a plan for building it. Weâll also read about and discuss deliberately constructed societies, both fictional ones and ones that people have really tried to make and live inâsome science fiction, some proposals, some real-life documents. What do societies or communities need in order to function? To function well? What can we learn about our own world by inventing others, and by looking at worlds that other people have invented and tried to build? The class will include some full-group and small-group discussions and activities to think about the reading, develop your design for âyourâ society, and help you write your story or plan.

How does society define us? How do we begin to name and define ourselves? Part 1 of this course leads participants through a series of prompts, games, and exercises centered around identity, selfhood, and power. We’ll rant and rave, question and critique, experiment and play.\nPart 2: Invisible Cities\nWhat if you were in charge of everything in the world? In this portion of the class, you’ll design a society, community or culture and write a story about it or a plan for building it. We’ll also read about and discuss deliberately constructed societies, both fictional ones and ones that people have really tried to make and live in–some science fiction, some proposals, some real-life documents. What do societies or communities need in order to function? To function well? What can we learn about our own world by inventing others, and by looking at worlds that other people have invented and tried to build? The class will include some full-group and small-group discussions and activities to think about the reading, develop your design for “your” society, and help you write your story or plan.\nINSTRUCTORS: Franny Choi (weeks 1&2) and Kate Schapira (weeks 3&4)\nDATES: Tuesdays and Thursdays, July 28th-August 20th.\nTIME: 10:00am-12pm\nWHERE: 186 Carpenter Street\nTuition: Sliding scale $75.00, $100, or pay what you can.

What does it mean to be a man? Comedian Ray Harrington has struggled with that question all of his life. Like many, he was raised by a single mother without any male influences to guide his awkward stumble into manhood. Now with a baby on the way, Ray realizes that before he can be a father, he needs to know what it means to be a man. Be A Man is a personal and heartwarming look at one manâs struggle to find his place in the world. Often laugh out loud funny, the film is wonderfully touching as Ray and his film crew welcome the viewer in as another friend on the journey of examining manliness and masculinity in modern culture.  Along the way, Ray asks for advice and help from fellow comedians and experts in their fields. Kyle Kinane, Bobby Kelly, Steve Rannazzisi, Doug Stanhope, and more all share their views on what it means to be a man. Ray steps into the ring to face 5 time world champion, Vinny Pazienza.

The General Stanton Flea Market features booths selling antiques, collectibles, new and boutique items, crafts, art and Farmers' Market merchandise.  According to Janice Falcone, who has owned and operated both the Inn and the Flea Market since 1973, people selling local produce, plants, vegetables and other Farmers' Market items, have added a desired new dimension to the Flea Market during the last few seasons.  'Well, let's say they give us a 'fresh' look, Falcone quips. 'Tomato and basil plants, bright flowers, delicious mid-summer fruits and vegetables and  jams--they all seem quite at home among the wooden kitchen tools, hand-woven baskets and and all the other farmhouse antiques and collectibles sold here each week.'  'We'd also like to see a wider variety of 'home-grown' crafts for sale this year. On a peak Summer Sunday, we can get 1,000 to 2,000 folks out here browsing and buying-- and many of them are from different states and different countries.  Many are hoping to head home with something handmade from this area--a real souvenir from Rhode Island. Perhaps some of the on-line sellers around here, might want to take a break this summer and set up here. There's no better--or more fun-- place to spend some 'face-time' than at a Flea Market!'  The octogenarian Ms. Falcone also hopes to attract a few more food trucks to Charlestown over the next six months.  'In past seasons, the aroma of that popping Kettle Korn and the puckering, refreshing taste of Del's Lemonade have added to the festive feel at our Flea Market. Yet to be able to grab a Greek salad or a fish taco here at the Flea Market, would be something else, altogether...'  10 x 20-feet booths are available at rates ranging from $20.-$35, depending on the location. Selling areas are available against the fence, on the grass and in pre-tarped rows. Vendors need to supply their own tables, chairs and sunbrellas, if they are not choosing a booth under the pre-tarped sections of the Market.  The Flea Market is set among the seven, tree-lined acres that make up the property of  the historic, General Joseph Stanton Inn, which was established in 1667.  It is one of the oldest inns in the country and was once a regular coach stop between Providence and New London.. It is located at 4115 Old Post Road in Charlestown, 02813.  The General Stanton Inn Flea Market also welcomes what Ms. Falcone refers to as 'instant tag sales.'  'We love our full-Season vendors, yet if you just want to set up your own, one-time, tag sale right here, we're fine with that. Why not take advantage of our built-in publicity and ever-expanding customer base, and clear out your cottage and garage of things someone else can use?'  Ms. Falcone is especially proud of the Flea Market's role in the  community.  All non-profit organizations are invited to set up sales and/or informational booths at the Flea Market on any weekend, free of charge.  'We're also Charlestown's 'cracker barrel,' where neighbors come to meet and greet and exchange town and beach news. I can't tell you how many times someone has stopped me while I'm buzzing around the market on my motorized cart, and asked me if I've seen 'so-and-so' that day.  And more often than not, I have.'  The General Stanton Inn Flea Market is now open Saturdays, Sundays and Holiday Mondays through Columbus Day, 8 a.m.-4p.m.  (Since late April, it has been open on Sundays only.)

Experience an extravaganza of performances and art installations throughout the city and join the parade converging on Kennedy Plaza during this signature showcase event.\nABOUT: In 2013, the City of Providence Department of Art, Culture + Tourism (AC+T) and FirstWorks, a non-profit cultural organization dedicated to building community through firsts in the arts, were jointly awarded a second Our Town grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in the amount of $75,000. One of 59 grants awarded nationally, this funding was for design envisioning a cultural corridor in downtown Providence, and to establish the FirstWorks Festival on the Plaza as a biennial signature event in Providence. Leadership investments in the Festival have been made by The City of Providence, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rhode Island Foundation, and GTECH.\n“This federal funding will enhance Providence’s efforts to use the arts as a catalyst for economic development. Encouraging creative activity and investing in the arts will pay dividends culturally and economically for the entire city,” said U.S. Senator Jack Reed who oversees federal arts funding as the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior.\nThe Festival initiative kicked off in September 2014 with the Urban Carnevale – an evening of music, art and spectacle at The Providence Rink that marked the 10th anniversary celebrations of both FirstWorks and the Department of Art, Culture + Tourism. AC+T convened a charrette for cultural leaders, residents, business owners, artists, students, academics, transit users, and other stakeholders who were asked to think creatively about how to transform Washington Street into a lively, pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare that reflects the capital city’s vibrant cultural landscape.\nIn February 2015, propelled by Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s vision for a cultural destination festival, the Festival was renamed The Providence International Arts Festival and the dates were set for June 11-14, 2015 for an inaugural event. Among the lead community arts partners joining FirstWorks and AC+T are The Avenue Concept, a Creative Partner for public art, Providence’s Union Studios, working to illustrate the community vision for Washington Street; and youth-led design/build projects by DownCity Design and temporary artist installations for the June 2015 First Works on the Plaza.\nEfforts to use public art programming to revitalize downtown Providence were piloted 2011 with support from a $200,000 Our Town grant that culminated in the success of the 2012 FirstWorks Festival: On the Plaza. The FirstWorks Festival, developed in collaboration between the City of Providence, FirstWorks and the Downtown Providence Parks Conservancy, along with18 partners and drew an estimated 40,000 people into downtown Providence.

Each of MAP’s out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids’ voices to the stage.\n“This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we’ve discussed the importance of public parks in our lives – what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,” says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. “Our goal is to bring kids’ voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow’s creative thinkers and community leaders.”\nThis program is supported by the National Park Foundation’s “Ticket to Ride” program.\nThe Manton Avenue Project’s 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.

But, thanks to the Opera at the Ballpark\nprogram, you can watch a live simulcast\nof the very same opera on the giant HD screens in the ballpark from any seat at AT&T Park totally free. The live simulcast will be transmitted from the War Memorial Opera House to AT&T Park’s 103-feet wide high definition video board . 2015 Opera at the Ballpark\nSaturday, July 3, 2015 | 7:30 pm\nAT&T Park, SF\nFREE, but an RSVP\nis required for Early Entry Tickets\nIf you RSVP you get to enter early at 6 pm\nand will have a better chance at seats on the field. Without reservations you can’t enter until 6:30 pm.\nThe opera is about 3 hours an Caltrain will run a special post-event train on the night of the opera. The train will leave 25 minutes after the end of the simulcast, or when full. About the Opera:\nMozart’s warmest, wisest opera is one of the composer’s most gracefulcreations—a tender comedy in which a countess and her servant join forces to punish her aristocrat husband for his philandering. In the process, two very different couples learn humbling lessons about life and love. Visit sfopera.com/figaro\nfor photos, audio and video clips, cast listing and a full synopsis. Opera Length:\nThe simulcast will last approximately 3 hours, 40 minutes, including two intermissions, during which you can stretch, roam the ballpark, chat with friends or fellow fans or enjoy ballpark hotdogs and garlic fries. Field Seating:\nTo sit on the field, we strongly suggest you enter the Ballpark through the Marina Gate (located directly behind centerfield and near the Ferry Dock Landing). Arrive early; field seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Your whole party should be present at the time of entry, because once the Giants determine the field is full, the Marina Gate will be closed to further admittance. You may bring blankets (no lawn chairs) to sit on the field. Remember to bring your barcoded confirmation printout for early entry.

The comic will say “I like my women like I like my…” or “I like my men like I like my…” and you yell out whatever you want. Seriously…whatever you want. The comic will then complete the sentence with a punchline. For example, “I like my women like I like my table lamps…picked out by my mother.” This is a lightning round of skill and wit\n.\nAt the end of Round 3, the audience will determine a winner. The winner receives all of the money in the Tip Jar of Justice and gets to perform some of their stand-up\n.

The night is hosted by Josh Argyle.\nIt’s Just Two Minutes is a three round improvised stand-up comedy game-show\nthat couldn’t exist without you, the audience. 9 comics take turns improvising stand-up sets based on one or two word prompts presented to them as they individually take the stage.\nIt’s Just Two Minutes Format:\nIn Round\n1, the comics are given a one or two word prompt\n. They then improvise 2 minute of stand-up just for you, the audience. It’s 120 seconds of wit and hilarity. Round 2\nis the story round\n. Comics are given a simple prompt such as embarrassing story or bad date story then they open up to you, the audience, as you laugh uncontrollably at their awkward lives. Round 3\nrequires a little help from you, the audience. In this round, you provide several prompts to the comics. The comic will say “I like my women like I like my…” or “I like my men like I like my…” and you yell out whatever you want. Seriously…whatever you want. The comic will then complete the sentence with a punchline. For example, “I like my women like I like my table lamps…picked out by my mother.” This is a lightning round of skill and wit\n.\nAt the end of Round 3, the audience will determine a winner. The winner receives all of the money in the Tip Jar of Justice and gets to perform some of their stand-up\n.

The night is hosted by Josh Argyle.\nIt’s Just Two Minutes is a three round improvised stand-up comedy game-show\nthat couldn’t exist without you, the audience. 9 comics take turns improvising stand-up sets based on one or two word prompts presented to them as they individually take the stage.\nIt’s Just Two Minutes Format:\nIn Round\n1, the comics are given a one or two word prompt\n. They then improvise 2 minute of stand-up just for you, the audience. It’s 120 seconds of wit and hilarity. Round 2\nis the story round\n. Comics are given a simple prompt such as embarrassing story or bad date story then they open up to you, the audience, as you laugh uncontrollably at their awkward lives. Round 3\nrequires a little help from you, the audience. In this round, you provide several prompts to the comics. The comic will say “I like my women like I like my…” or “I like my men like I like my…” and you yell out whatever you want. Seriously…whatever you want. The comic will then complete the sentence with a punchline. For example, “I like my women like I like my table lamps…picked out by my mother.” This is a lightning round of skill and wit\n.\nAt the end of Round 3, the audience will determine a winner. The winner receives all of the money in the Tip Jar of Justice and gets to perform some of their stand-up\n.

Experience an extravaganza of performances and art installations throughout the city and join the parade converging on Kennedy Plaza during this signature showcase event.\nABOUT: In 2013, the City of Providence Department of Art, Culture + Tourism (AC+T) and FirstWorks, a non-profit cultural organization dedicated to building community through firsts in the arts, were jointly awarded a second Our Town grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in the amount of $75,000. One of 59 grants awarded nationally, this funding was for design envisioning a cultural corridor in downtown Providence, and to establish the FirstWorks Festival on the Plaza as a biennial signature event in Providence. Leadership investments in the Festival have been made by The City of Providence, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rhode Island Foundation, and GTECH.\n“This federal funding will enhance Providence’s efforts to use the arts as a catalyst for economic development. Encouraging creative activity and investing in the arts will pay dividends culturally and economically for the entire city,” said U.S. Senator Jack Reed who oversees federal arts funding as the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior.\nThe Festival initiative kicked off in September 2014 with the Urban Carnevale – an evening of music, art and spectacle at The Providence Rink that marked the 10th anniversary celebrations of both FirstWorks and the Department of Art, Culture + Tourism. AC+T convened a charrette for cultural leaders, residents, business owners, artists, students, academics, transit users, and other stakeholders who were asked to think creatively about how to transform Washington Street into a lively, pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare that reflects the capital city’s vibrant cultural landscape.\nIn February 2015, propelled by Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s vision for a cultural destination festival, the Festival was renamed The Providence International Arts Festival and the dates were set for June 11-14, 2015 for an inaugural event. Among the lead community arts partners joining FirstWorks and AC+T are The Avenue Concept, a Creative Partner for public art, Providence’s Union Studios, working to illustrate the community vision for Washington Street; and youth-led design/build projects by DownCity Design and temporary artist installations for the June 2015 First Works on the Plaza.\nEfforts to use public art programming to revitalize downtown Providence were piloted 2011 with support from a $200,000 Our Town grant that culminated in the success of the 2012 FirstWorks Festival: On the Plaza. The FirstWorks Festival, developed in collaboration between the City of Providence, FirstWorks and the Downtown Providence Parks Conservancy, along with18 partners and drew an estimated 40,000 people into downtown Providence.

The people shown… are as varied and vivid as their city.”\n–The Boston Globe\nHave you ever really looked at the people around you – your neighbors, the people walking past you on the street, the folks living and working all around you? “Seen/Unseen: Providence” is a project that has crisscrossed our city’s neighborhoods, documenting the images and lives of those people in a way that forces us to stop and take notice. Photographer Mary Beth Meehan shows us Providence as it lives and breathes, and now her images will stand writ large with 10 large-scale prints adorning buildings along the Washington Street Cultural Corridor. The installation begins facing Empire Street at Trinity Rep, and continues down Washington Street. City Hall will also feature a larger exhibition of portraits, along with text from Meehan’s “Seen/Unseen” blog (marybethmeehan.tumblr.com), on which she documents the creation of the project. These are striking depictions of the people we live amongst every day, but don’t often truly see. Seen/Unseen is part of the Providence International Arts Festival June 11-14 put on by FirstWorks & the City of Providence.

Throughout his practice, Dave Cole juxtaposes such hazardous materials with the nostalgia of childhood to elucidate tensions between the ideal and the real.\nThis exhibition brings together iconic sculptures such as the Fiberglass Teddy Bear and The Music Box (2012), a vintage steamroller that has been retrofitted to play the Star Spangled Banner, alongside smaller works such as Toy Soldier Flag (2006), an American flag made from melted plastic toy soldier; Three Generations (2013), which consists of three models of hand grenades fashioned as baby rattles; and Kevlar Romper (2008), a toddler’s outfit sewn from repurposed Gulf War Kevlar. While many of the objects exhibited here evoke images of play, they are also poignant reminders of how both the military and infrastructure building influence the construction of national identity in the United States. Cole repeatedly returns to the signs and symbols of American military and economic power—from guns and flags to icons of industrialism—using various loaded materials to critically reconstruct their meanings. His work is at once aggressive, patriotic, incisive, and nostalgic. Drawing on the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child, his sculptures suggest we are all complicit in the construction of the symbolic meaning of our national icons.

How does society define us? How do we begin to name and define ourselves? Part 1 of this course leads participants through a series of prompts, games, and exercises centered around identity, selfhood, and power. We’ll rant and rave, question and critique, experiment and play. Part 2: Invisible Cities\nWhat if you were in charge of everything in the world? In this portion of the class, you’ll design a society, community or culture and write a story about it or a plan for building it. We’ll also read about and discuss deliberately constructed societies, both fictional ones and ones that people have really tried to make and live in–some science fiction, some proposals, some real-life documents. What do societies or communities need in order to function? To function well? What can we learn about our own world by inventing others, and by looking at worlds that other people have invented and tried to build? The class will include some full-group and small-group discussions and activities to think about the reading, develop your design for “your” society, and help you write your story or plan.

Through organizing, manipulating, repeating, and translating everyday objects and scenarios, the exhibition excavates the different material layers in life to examine the tension, dread and uncertainty under the duress of continuously accelerating time.

Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. “This Land Is Our land” was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D’Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!\nThe Manton Avenue Project’s (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP’s out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids’ voices to the stage.\n“This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we’ve discussed the importance of public parks in our lives – what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,” says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. “Our goal is to bring kids’ voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow’s creative thinkers and community leaders.”\nThis program is supported by the National Park Foundation’s “Ticket to Ride” program.\nThe Manton Avenue Project’s 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.

It's on!!!  If there is no energy in the room, he brings it. If there IS energy in the room, Corey absorbs it, electrifies it, and then takes it to another level.  Featured in season one of Nick Jr.’s NickMom Night Out Comedy Showcase, Corey was the Winner of the World Series of Comedy East Coast Regional Satellite Competition at Goodnights Comedy Club in July of 2011, and out of 101 comedians he finished in the Top Eight in the WSOC Finals in Las Vegas. With a resume that includes performances in Jamie Foxx's LAFFAPALOOZA's New Faces In Comedy, headlining comedy clubs nationally, and touring with comedians such as Mo'Nique, Tracey Morgan, Bill Burr, Damon Wayans, Lavell Crawford, John Witherspoon, Bill Bellamy, and Bonnie MacFarlane; Corey is known for his 'Slick, upbeat, funny, over-the-top comedy.'  Corey has yet to find an audience he can't entertain, or a topic he can't cover. From discussing culture, college life, being a NCP (non-custodial parent), the positives and negatives of social media, relationships and his experience with 'Girls Night Out', Corey can cover the most challenging topics, in a tasteful and insightful way. Although there is usually no filter or safety net to Corey's performance, upon request he can provide entertainment that is appropriate and/or can be tailored to any audiences.  So if you're ready for a laugh of a life time, call Corey Manning to your rescue. He is your Comedian By Night. Superhero = By Day.

	{"source":"","name":"Mike Finoia","location":"Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,","description":"Mike Finoia of Milford never feels more alive, he says, than when he’s standing on a stage, exposing his deepest secrets to complete strangers, and they’re laughing. “Nothing can compare to it,” he says. “Nothing. And when it happened for the very first time, at Caroline’s in New York, well, it was an out-of-body experience.” Since that magic moment at Caroline’s, which came at the conclusion of a stand-up comedy class he completed in December of 2010, Finoia has performed in lots of places and made lots of people laugh at him and his secrets. According to his website, www.mikefinoia.com, he’s joked about everything from his “chicken-stealing great-grandfather to his ex-fiancee and his own father’s epic laziness.” He’s told his stories to everyone from the Gotham Comedy Club, the Cabaret at Mohegan Sun Casino, Comix at Foxwoods, to Joker’s Wild in New Haven. And plenty of other places besides. His goal, he says, is to sign every green room wall from Maine to San Diego. Now New Haveners who might have missed him at Joker’s Wild have a chance not only to see him perform this Saturday at Cafe Nine, but they can also have their own CD/DVD to enjoy the show again and again. He’s doing the DVDs to help take his career to the next level, hoping that people attending will pass it along to friends who will also like it. “I’m proud of this material,” he says, “and I want to record it. It’s a good snapshot of what I do. It may not ever end up on Comedy Central, but it’s capturing this moment.” Finoia, like a lot of comedians working today, started studying comedy from a very young age, long before he ever considered it a profession. He realized early on that making people laugh was a wonderful goal. He loves his grandfather, whom he describes as a “big, tough ironworker who could make any story into a funny one,” and his father, who has a dry wit that capitalizes on pop culture references. Finoia, 32, who was raised in North Haven in a big Italian family, says he watched “Saturday Night Live” and “Night at the Improv” with his parents from the time he was really very little. “I didn’t get all the jokes,” he says, “but I got the rhythm of comedy. I could feel the math of comedy, the set-up, set-up, punchline that meant it was time to laugh. Jerry Seinfeld could be telling a joke in Chinese, and yet we would know when to laugh.” Stand-up comedy was just an extension of what he said he’d really been doing all his life. “It feels a bit like being a little kid in the deep end of the pool,” he says. “You’re holding on, scared of drowning, and then you just let go — and you go under, but you bob back up to the top and you’re swimming. You’re OK. It’s a liberating moment.” The best moments are connecting the audience to those moments that everyone experiences, he says. “Everybody thinks about the quirky things in their lives, and to have someone onstage talk about those things — well, it sparks something in them. I want to have those connections.” His own favorite contemporary comedians are Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Patton Oswalt, and Paul F. Tompkins, yet he was influenced by Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin. “I can still remember laughing with my father, watching Steve Martin’s ‘Wild and Crazy Guy’ routine,” he says. In his own routines, he talks about the 17 years he spent following the band Phish, for instance, or the time he spent living in Oregon with Ken Kesey, the author of “One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” or how it was growing up in the 1980s before the Internet was fully operational. “When I went to college, they told me they were giving me an email address,” he says, “and I asked them where I should go to pick it up. My sisters and brothers, who are lots younger than I am, always had the Internet. They’re wired differently. In some ways, I have more in common with the cavemen than I have with them.” Finoia says preparing for an hour-long stand-up show is a lot like preparing a buffet meal. “I take a few of my experiences from all different parts of my life, a pinch of this, a little of this, and I prepare a plate for the audience. It’s a lot of fun.”","datetime":"2015-07-31, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,","price":"","imagePath":"https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/557b1c99718e85.42756390-album_list_small.jpg","dump":"Mike Finoia of Milford never feels more alive, he says, than when he’s standing on a stage, exposing his deepest secrets to complete strangers, and they’re laughing. “Nothing can compare to it,” he says. “Nothing.

Sometimes it makes those people angry. Sometimes it makes them happy. I don’t care. What’s most important to me is the laughter of strangers. (Healthy, right?)\n\nSince my first awful set, I’ve done some things I never thought could happen. I got to tell jokes at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival, New York Comedy Expo, and the Bumbershoot Music & Arts Festival. I also got to work with some people I only saw on TV including: Robert Kelly (Tourgasm), Jim Norton (Opie & Anthony) and Ben Bailey (Host of Cash Cab.)\n\nPeople generally find me relatable and funny (except for Mobile, Alabama and Reno, Nevada– they say I speak too fast.) Seeing me live will help me move out of my Mom’s quicker. You don’t want me to be a loser forever, do you?"},

Thursday, Friday, Saturday 7:00 PM. Saturday and Sunday 2:00 PM. Three Sisters is Anton Chekhov's classic 1901 portrait of Russia's disappearing aristocratic class and their quest for meaning and fulfillment in the ever-changing modern world. Written in 1900 and first produced in 1901, Three Sisters was Chekhov's first specific commission for the Moscow Arts Theatre. A year after the death of their father, an army officer, the Moscow-bred Prosorovs, including the three sisters Olga, Masha, Irina, and one brother Andrew, are finding life drab and increasingly hopeless in a provincial Russian town. Only the proximity of a nearby artillery post and the company of its officers make their existence bearable. Each of the sisters is in pursuit of love and happiness, but both of these desires seem increasingly out of reach as the play progresses. The play has often been described as 'the decline of the aristocratic and artistic elite coupled with the search for meaning in a modern world.' Chekhov offers us the Prozorov siblings, who are refined and cultured youth, raised in Moscow but living a small and 'lifeless' provincial town for the past eleven years. With the recent death of their father Colonel Prozorov, they await a return to Moscow where the 'good life' can begin again.

Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. 'This Land Is Our land' was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park! The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage. 'This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,' says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. 'Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders.' This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's 'Ticket to Ride' program. The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.","datetime":"Saturday, August 22, 2015 6:30 pm","price":"Free","imagePath":"http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/H1tnsLls7c6hOzZHGN1N2g/ml.jpg","dump":"Skip to Search Form qqsaysws Skip to Navigation Skip to Page Content Yelp Find Near Sign Up Log In Home About Me Write a Review Find Friends Messages Talk Events Add A Photo manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial Category: Performing Arts When: Saturday, August 22, 2015 6:30 pm Add to Calendar Google Calendar iCal / Outlook Where: Roger Williams National Memorial 1 review 282 N Main St Providence , RI 02903 (401) 521-7266 How: Official Website Tickets Cost: Free Submitted by: Emily L.

Tickets are on-sale at now! When the two Kentucky boys--Eddie, is from Lancaster and Troy is from Lexington--first burst onto the national scene in 1999 with the defiant 'Hillbilly Shoes' notice was served--country music had never seen a hard driving duo like this. Despite the millions of albums sold, the sold out shows and the scores of awards, Montgomery Gentry remains in touch with its working class roots. 'We are blue collar workers and we lived the songs that we sing,' says Troy. 'Because of that, our fans are able to make the connection and when they hear our songs, they know we are singing with passion and we know what we are talking about.' 'Unlike other awards, becoming members of the Grand Ole Opry is something people can't take away from you,' Troy says. 'Other awards come and go, but once you become a member of the Opry, you are a member for life--that's something that Eddie and I are very proud to be a part of.' There's no doubt that they're hard-running honky tonkers, but Eddie and Troy are also empathetic citizens of the world. Acknowledged by the Academy of Country Music as the 2010 winners of its Humanitarian Award, they devote their time and energy into making the needs of others a priority. They are active participants in many charitable organizations, including the U.S. military and numerous charitable organizations such as the TJ Martell Foundation, Camp Horsin' Around and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Middle Tennessee, among numerous others. Make no mistake about it: Montgomery Gentry has secured a place in musical history with a unique blend of country, southern rock and Everly Brothers-like harmonies combined with relatable lyrics. This is especially evident with their latest radio release, 'Headlights', from the highly anticipated album slated to be released in early 2015. With infectious lyrics and an anthem feel, this latest offering from the duo will have fans partying on tailgates well into the future.

Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. 'This Land Is Our land' was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park! The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage. 'This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,' says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. 'Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders.' This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's 'Ticket to Ride' program. The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.","datetime":"Saturday, June 20, 2015 6:30 pm","price":"Free","imagePath":"http://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/57wTzk-wFbsTJu-4in0aUg/ml.jpg","dump":"Skip to Search Form qqsaysws Skip to Navigation Skip to Page Content Yelp Find Near Sign Up Log In Home About Me Write a Review Find Friends Messages Talk Events Add A Photo manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial Category: Performing Arts When: Saturday, June 20, 2015 6:30 pm Add to Calendar Google Calendar iCal / Outlook Where: Roger Williams National Memorial 1 review 282 N Main St Providence , RI 02903 (401) 521-7266 How: Official Website Tickets Cost: Free Submitted by: Emily L.

The PMC Kids Rides Program offers children, parents, and neighbors an opportunity to work together to create individual bike-a-thons in neighborhoods, at schools, or in business complexes.

'This Land Is Our land' was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park! The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage. 'This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,' says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. 'Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders.' This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's 'Ticket to Ride' program. The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.","datetime":"Saturday, July 11, 2015 6:30 pm","price":"Free","imagePath":"http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/kuVxS6aew2hHp2LJBxT85w/ml.jpg","dump":"Skip to Search Form Skip to Navigation Skip to Page Content Yelp Find Near Sign Up Log In Home About Me Write a Review Find Friends Messages Talk Events Add A Photo manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial Category: Performing Arts When: Saturday, July 11, 2015 6:30 pm Add to Calendar Google Calendar iCal / Outlook Where: Roger Williams National Memorial 1 review 282 N Main St Providence , RI 02903 (401) 521-7266 How: Official Website Tickets Cost: Free Submitted by: Emily L.
