During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right.  'Drawing Ambience' features an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu.

During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right.\n'Drawing Ambience' features an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu. The drawings are complemented by a series of related folios published by the AA representing the work of Peter Cook, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Kisa Kawakami, among others.

Showtime is 8:00 P.M.  Tickets are $35.00.  The venue is at 59 Main St, E. Greenwich, RI.  For more information call 401-885-4000.  Please check out this wonderful live review of their recent performance in Ocean City in Atlantic City Weekly:  http://tinyurl.com/lp8cdut  The Machine has forged a 25 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own. Over the years, The Machine has touched the hearts and souls of many, selling out theaters, large clubs and casinos across North and Central America, Europe and Asia. They have also appeared at renowned music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Riverbend, Gathering of the Vibes, Buffalo's Artpark, and Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rock of Ages.  The New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for performing a diverse mix of The Floyd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of popular hits as well as obscure gems), The Machine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stellar musicianship, dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest.  In the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even rivaling that of an early 1970\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A to Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the alphabet.  Additionally, the quartet has been sharing the stage with full symphony orchestras, including the Atlanta, Detroit, Pittsburgh and San Diego Symphonies.  In 2004, Two Nights at the Keswick was released as a DVD/CD, archiving the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bi-annual residency at this historic Philadelphia venue.

Showtime is 8:00 P.M.  Tickets are $35.00.  The venue is at 59 Main St, E. Greenwich, RI.\nFor more information call 401-885-4000.\nPlease check out this wonderful live review of their recent performance in Ocean City in Atlantic City Weekly:  http://tinyurl.com/lp8cdut\nThe Machine has forged a 25 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own. Over the years, The Machine has touched the hearts and souls of many, selling out theaters, large clubs and casinos across North and Central America, Europe and Asia. They have also appeared at renowned music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Riverbend, Gathering of the Vibes, Buffalo's Artpark, and Germany\u2019s Rock of Ages.\nThe New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for performing a diverse mix of The Floyd\u2019s extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of popular hits as well as obscure gems), The Machine\u2019s stellar musicianship, dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest.\nIn the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even rivaling that of an early 1970\u2019s Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980\u2019s. The band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A to Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the alphabet.\nAdditionally, the quartet has been sharing the stage with full symphony orchestras, including the Atlanta, Detroit, Pittsburgh and San Diego Symphonies.\nIn 2004, Two Nights at the Keswick was released as a DVD/CD, archiving the band\u2019s bi-annual residency at this historic Philadelphia venue. Their next release, Unplugged (2006) captures a special acoustic performance at B.B. King\u2019s in NYC featuring rare Syd Barrett solo material and deep cuts from early Floyd albums. Live In Amsterdam, a stunning concert DVD filmed at the Pepsi Stage, was released in August of 2008.\nBand:\nAdam Minkoff - Bass/Vocals\nScott Chasolen - Keys/Vocals\nRyan Ball - Guitar/Vocals\nTahrah Cohen - Drums\n\u201cThe Machine duplicates the sound and hits of Pink Floyd with chilling accuracy.\u201d\n- Matt Diehl, Rolling Stone Magazine\n\u201cThe Machine sounds exactly like Pink Floyd\u201d\n- Matthew Weber, Spin Magazine\n\u201cYou know you\u2019ve got it going on when you sell out B.B.

Spirits and soft drinks are available. Desserts include tempting pies, ciders, and other baked goods. Cafe-style seating is set up throughout the Wharf.  Face-painting, pumpkin painting and other kid's activities alongside sailors from Oliver Hazard Perry, RI's official sailing education vessel.  As you savor fresh dishes, sit back and enjoy the beats from area bands. Under the music tent, live folk, Celtic, and blues music are just a taste of what you'll hear.

We will read a number of biographical and autobiographical texts that play with questions of form and objectivity. And using \u201creal\u201d materials drawn from someone\u2019s life\u2014be it letters, journals, interview responses, voice recordings, etc.\u2014we will write our own, which later we will workshop during class. A willingness to engage closely with assigned readings and to experiment when working on one\u2019s own is expected. We should be ready to take risks, ready to put in the necessary work, and ready to enjoy the process.\nINSTRUCTOR: Victor Wildman\nDATES: Wednesdays, June 17-July 22nd.\nTIME: 6:30pm-9pm\nWHERE: 186 Carpenter Street\nTuition: $250.00 Print Email Tweet Report an inappropriate comment\nComments\n\u00a9 2015 Providence Media | Providence Monthly | East Side Monthly | So Rhode Island | The Bay | Read the current issue | About Us | Contact Us | Advertise\nPowered By: Creative Circle Advertising Solutions, Inc\n.", "price": "", "datetime": ",6:30-9:00 pm", "source": "http://www.providenceonline.com/stories/Everybodys-Autobiography-A-Frequency-Workshop,15437", "location": "Frequency 186 Carpenter Providence, Rhode Island", "time": ["6:30", "6:30"], "date": ["June 17, 2015", "July 22, 2015", "June , "], "name": "Everybody's Autobiography: A Frequency Workshop"}, {"imagePath": "http://www.providenceonline.com", "addresses": {"numLocations": 1, "addresses": [{"city": "Kingstown", "full_street": "44 Main Street North", "post_direction": "North", "street_number": "44", "floor": null, "street_name": "Main", "country_id": "US", "full_address": "44 Main Street North Kingstown, RI", "route_id": null, "region1": "RI", "street_type": "Street", "postal_code": null, "occupancy": null, "building_id": null}]}, "description": "A quartet of local opera singers will present a concert titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBroadway Lights and Opera Starts\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the First Baptist Church of Wickford on June 14, 2015 at 3:00pm.

The General Stanton Flea Market features booths selling antiques, collectibles, new and boutique items, crafts, art and Farmers' Market merchandise.  According to Janice Falcone, who has owned and operated both the Inn and the Flea Market since 1973, people selling local produce, plants, vegetables and other Farmers' Market items, have added a desired new dimension to the Flea Market during the last few seasons.  'Well, let's say they give us a 'fresh' look, Falcone quips. 'Tomato and basil plants, bright flowers, delicious mid-summer fruits and vegetables and  jams--they all seem quite at home among the wooden kitchen tools, hand-woven baskets and and all the other farmhouse antiques and collectibles sold here each week.'  'We'd also like to see a wider variety of 'home-grown' crafts for sale this year. On a peak Summer Sunday, we can get 1,000 to 2,000 folks out here browsing and buying-- and many of them are from different states and different countries.  Many are hoping to head home with something handmade from this area--a real souvenir from Rhode Island. Perhaps some of the on-line sellers around here, might want to take a break this summer and set up here. There's no better--or more fun-- place to spend some 'face-time' than at a Flea Market!'  The octogenarian Ms. Falcone also hopes to attract a few more food trucks to Charlestown over the next six months.  'In past seasons, the aroma of that popping Kettle Korn and the puckering, refreshing taste of Del's Lemonade have added to the festive feel at our Flea Market. Yet to be able to grab a Greek salad or a fish taco here at the Flea Market, would be something else, altogether...'  10 x 20-feet booths are available at rates ranging from $20.-$35, depending on the location. Selling areas are available against the fence, on the grass and in pre-tarped rows. Vendors need to supply their own tables, chairs and sunbrellas, if they are not choosing a booth under the pre-tarped sections of the Market.  The Flea Market is set among the seven, tree-lined acres that make up the property of  the historic, General Joseph Stanton Inn, which was established in 1667.  It is one of the oldest inns in the country and was once a regular coach stop between Providence and New London.. It is located at 4115 Old Post Road in Charlestown, 02813.  The General Stanton Inn Flea Market also welcomes what Ms. Falcone refers to as 'instant tag sales.'  'We love our full-Season vendors, yet if you just want to set up your own, one-time, tag sale right here, we're fine with that. Why not take advantage of our built-in publicity and ever-expanding customer base, and clear out your cottage and garage of things someone else can use?'  Ms. Falcone is especially proud of the Flea Market's role in the  community.  All non-profit organizations are invited to set up sales and/or informational booths at the Flea Market on any weekend, free of charge.  'We're also Charlestown's 'cracker barrel,' where neighbors come to meet and greet and exchange town and beach news. I can't tell you how many times someone has stopped me while I'm buzzing around the market on my motorized cart, and asked me if I've seen 'so-and-so' that day.  And more often than not, I have.'  The General Stanton Inn Flea Market is now open Saturdays, Sundays and Holiday Mondays through Columbus Day, 8 a.m.-4p.m.  (Since late April, it has been open on Sundays only.)

Experience an extravaganza of performances and art installations throughout the city and join the parade converging on Kennedy Plaza during this signature showcase event.\nABOUT: In 2013, the City of Providence Department of Art, Culture + Tourism (AC+T) and FirstWorks, a non-profit cultural organization dedicated to building community through firsts in the arts, were jointly awarded a second Our Town grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in the amount of $75,000. One of 59 grants awarded nationally, this funding was for design envisioning a cultural corridor in downtown Providence, and to establish the FirstWorks Festival on the Plaza as a biennial signature event in Providence. Leadership investments in the Festival have been made by The City of Providence, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rhode Island Foundation, and GTECH.\n\u201cThis federal funding will enhance Providence\u2019s efforts to use the arts as a catalyst for economic development. Encouraging creative activity and investing in the arts will pay dividends culturally and economically for the entire city,\u201d said U.S. Senator Jack Reed who oversees federal arts funding as the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior.\nThe Festival initiative kicked off in September 2014 with the Urban Carnevale \u2013 an evening of music, art and spectacle at The Providence Rink that marked the 10th anniversary celebrations of both FirstWorks and the Department of Art, Culture + Tourism. AC+T convened a charrette for cultural leaders, residents, business owners, artists, students, academics, transit users, and other stakeholders who were asked to think creatively about how to transform Washington Street into a lively, pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare that reflects the capital city\u2019s vibrant cultural landscape.\nIn February 2015, propelled by Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza\u2019s vision for a cultural destination festival, the Festival was renamed The Providence International Arts Festival and the dates were set for June 11-14, 2015 for an inaugural event. Among the lead community arts partners joining FirstWorks and AC+T are The Avenue Concept, a Creative Partner for public art, Providence\u2019s Union Studios, working to illustrate the community vision for Washington Street; and youth-led design/build projects by DownCity Design and temporary artist installations for the June 2015 First Works on the Plaza.\nEfforts to use public art programming to revitalize downtown Providence were piloted 2011 with support from a $200,000 Our Town grant that culminated in the success of the 2012 FirstWorks Festival: On the Plaza. The FirstWorks Festival, developed in collaboration between the City of Providence, FirstWorks and the Downtown Providence Parks Conservancy, along with18 partners and drew an estimated 40,000 people into downtown Providence.

During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right. Drawing Ambience\nfeatures an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu. The drawings are complemented by a series of related folios published by the AA representing the work of Peter Cook, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Kisa Kawakami, among others. Together, these works provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore both the techniques and the imaginative spirit of drawing practices that permeated this time of change and experimentation in architecture worldwide. Drawing Ambience\nis co-organized by the RISD Museum and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Washington University in St. Louis. It is accompanied by a fully illustrated 152-page catalogue. The exhibition opens at the Kemper Art Museum on September 12, 2014, and is on view at the RISD Museum from April 24 to August 2, 2015.

Field Seating:\nTo sit on the field, we strongly suggest you enter the Ballpark through the Marina Gate (located directly behind centerfield and near the Ferry Dock Landing). Arrive early; field seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis. Your whole party should be present at the time of entry, because once the Giants determine the field is full, the Marina Gate will be closed to further admittance.

The night is hosted by Josh Argyle.\nIt\u2019s Just Two Minutes is a three round improvised stand-up comedy game-show\nthat couldn\u2019t exist without you, the audience. 9 comics take turns improvising stand-up sets based on one or two word prompts presented to them as they individually take the stage.\nIt\u2019s Just Two Minutes Format:\nIn Round\n1, the comics are given a one or two word prompt\n. They then improvise 2 minute of stand-up just for you, the audience. It\u2019s 120 seconds of wit and hilarity. Round 2\nis the story round\n. Comics are given a simple prompt such as embarrassing story or bad date story then they open up to you, the audience, as you laugh uncontrollably at their awkward lives. Round 3\nrequires a little help from you, the audience. In this round, you provide several prompts to the comics. The comic will say \u201cI like my women like I like my\u2026\u201d or \u201cI like my men like I like my\u2026\u201d and you yell out whatever you want. Seriously\u2026whatever you want. The comic will then complete the sentence with a punchline. For example, \u201cI like my women like I like my table lamps\u2026picked out by my mother.\u201d This is a lightning round of skill and wit\n.\nAt the end of Round 3, the audience will determine a winner. The winner receives all of the money in the Tip Jar of Justice and gets to perform some of their stand-up\n.

The night is hosted by Josh Argyle.\nIt\u2019s Just Two Minutes is a three round improvised stand-up comedy game-show\nthat couldn\u2019t exist without you, the audience. 9 comics take turns improvising stand-up sets based on one or two word prompts presented to them as they individually take the stage.\nIt\u2019s Just Two Minutes Format:\nIn Round\n1, the comics are given a one or two word prompt\n. They then improvise 2 minute of stand-up just for you, the audience. It\u2019s 120 seconds of wit and hilarity. Round 2\nis the story round\n. Comics are given a simple prompt such as embarrassing story or bad date story then they open up to you, the audience, as you laugh uncontrollably at their awkward lives. Round 3\nrequires a little help from you, the audience. In this round, you provide several prompts to the comics. The comic will say \u201cI like my women like I like my\u2026\u201d or \u201cI like my men like I like my\u2026\u201d and you yell out whatever you want. Seriously\u2026whatever you want. The comic will then complete the sentence with a punchline. For example, \u201cI like my women like I like my table lamps\u2026picked out by my mother.\u201d This is a lightning round of skill and wit\n.\nAt the end of Round 3, the audience will determine a winner.

The night is hosted by Josh Argyle.\nIt\u2019s Just Two Minutes is a three round improvised stand-up comedy game-show\nthat couldn\u2019t exist without you, the audience. 9 comics take turns improvising stand-up sets based on one or two word prompts presented to them as they individually take the stage.\nIt\u2019s Just Two Minutes Format:\nIn Round\n1, the comics are given a one or two word prompt\n. They then improvise 2 minute of stand-up just for you, the audience. It\u2019s 120 seconds of wit and hilarity. Round 2\nis the story round\n. Comics are given a simple prompt such as embarrassing story or bad date story then they open up to you, the audience, as you laugh uncontrollably at their awkward lives. Round 3\nrequires a little help from you, the audience. In this round, you provide several prompts to the comics. The comic will say \u201cI like my women like I like my\u2026\u201d or \u201cI like my men like I like my\u2026\u201d and you yell out whatever you want. Seriously\u2026whatever you want. The comic will then complete the sentence with a punchline. For example, \u201cI like my women like I like my table lamps\u2026picked out by my mother.\u201d This is a lightning round of skill and wit\n.\nAt the end of Round 3, the audience will determine a winner. The winner receives all of the money in the Tip Jar of Justice and gets to perform some of their stand-up\n.

Flags are available to use or you can just relax and take in the fun dance music and colorful visuals. Bring a beverage, a lunch, something to sit on, and enjoy. 2015 Flagging in the Park DJ\u00a0Russ Rich\nwill provide the tunes.\u00a0If you\u2019ve ever heard Russ spin, you\u2019ve probably left the dance floor with a smile on your face. That\u2019s because the music he loves to play is big, happy, vocal house, with a touch of gospel, progressive, tribal and tech thrown in\nto keep things moving.

Experience an extravaganza of performances and art installations throughout the city and join the parade converging on Kennedy Plaza during this signature showcase event.\nABOUT: In 2013, the City of Providence Department of Art, Culture + Tourism (AC+T) and FirstWorks, a non-profit cultural organization dedicated to building community through firsts in the arts, were jointly awarded a second Our Town grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in the amount of $75,000. One of 59 grants awarded nationally, this funding was for design envisioning a cultural corridor in downtown Providence, and to establish the FirstWorks Festival on the Plaza as a biennial signature event in Providence. Leadership investments in the Festival have been made by The City of Providence, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rhode Island Foundation, and GTECH.\n\u201cThis federal funding will enhance Providence\u2019s efforts to use the arts as a catalyst for economic development. Encouraging creative activity and investing in the arts will pay dividends culturally and economically for the entire city,\u201d said U.S. Senator Jack Reed who oversees federal arts funding as the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior.\nThe Festival initiative kicked off in September 2014 with the Urban Carnevale \u2013 an evening of music, art and spectacle at The Providence Rink that marked the 10th anniversary celebrations of both FirstWorks and the Department of Art, Culture + Tourism. AC+T convened a charrette for cultural leaders, residents, business owners, artists, students, academics, transit users, and other stakeholders who were asked to think creatively about how to transform Washington Street into a lively, pedestrian-friendly thoroughfare that reflects the capital city\u2019s vibrant cultural landscape.\nIn February 2015, propelled by Providence Mayor Jorge O. Elorza\u2019s vision for a cultural destination festival, the Festival was renamed The Providence International Arts Festival and the dates were set for June 11-14, 2015 for an inaugural event. Among the lead community arts partners joining FirstWorks and AC+T are The Avenue Concept, a Creative Partner for public art, Providence\u2019s Union Studios, working to illustrate the community vision for Washington Street; and youth-led design/build projects by DownCity Design and temporary artist installations for the June 2015 First Works on the Plaza.\nEfforts to use public art programming to revitalize downtown Providence were piloted 2011 with support from a $200,000 Our Town grant that culminated in the success of the 2012 FirstWorks Festival: On the Plaza. The FirstWorks Festival, developed in collaboration between the City of Providence, FirstWorks and the Downtown Providence Parks Conservancy, along with18 partners and drew an estimated 40,000 people into downtown Providence.

During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right. Drawing Ambience\nfeatures an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu. The drawings are complemented by a series of related folios published by the AA representing the work of Peter Cook, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Kisa Kawakami, among others. Together, these works provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore both the techniques and the imaginative spirit of drawing practices that permeated this time of change and experimentation in architecture worldwide. Drawing Ambience\nis co-organized by the RISD Museum and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Washington University in St. Louis. It is accompanied by a fully illustrated 152-page catalogue. The exhibition opens at the Kemper Art Museum on September 12, 2014, and is on view at the RISD Museum from April 24 to August 2, 2015. Drawing Ambience\nis supported by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.

Photographer Mary Beth Meehan shows us Providence as it lives and breathes, and now her images will stand writ large with 10 large-scale prints adorning buildings along the Washington Street Cultural Corridor. The installation begins facing Empire Street at Trinity Rep, and continues down Washington Street. City Hall will also feature a larger exhibition of portraits, along with text from Meehan\u2019s \u201cSeen/Unseen\u201d blog (marybethmeehan.tumblr.com), on which she documents the creation of the project. These are striking depictions of the people we live amongst every day, but don\u2019t often truly see.

Fiberglass Teddy Bear (2004), an enormous stuffed pink bear visible through the windows of List Art Building, appears like a charmingly silly commemoration of youthful innocence.

Both are knit from materials laden with tiny shards of glass, making them abhorrent to the touch and dangerous to the lungs: the bear from Owens Corning Fiberglas (typically used for home insulation) and the blanket from Fiberfrax (an industrial porcelain developed to replace asbestos). Throughout his practice, Dave Cole juxtaposes such hazardous materials with the nostalgia of childhood to elucidate tensions between the ideal and the real.\nThis exhibition brings together iconic sculptures such as the Fiberglass Teddy Bear and The Music Box (2012), a vintage steamroller that has been retrofitted to play the Star Spangled Banner, alongside smaller works such as Toy Soldier Flag (2006), an American flag made from melted plastic toy soldier; Three Generations (2013), which consists of three models of hand grenades fashioned as baby rattles; and Kevlar Romper (2008), a toddler\u2019s outfit sewn from repurposed Gulf War Kevlar. While many of the objects exhibited here evoke images of play, they are also poignant reminders of how both the military and infrastructure building influence the construction of national identity in the United States. Cole repeatedly returns to the signs and symbols of American military and economic power\u2014from guns and flags to icons of industrialism\u2014using various loaded materials to critically reconstruct their meanings. His work is at once aggressive, patriotic, incisive, and nostalgic. Drawing on the old adage that it takes a village to raise a child, his sculptures suggest we are all complicit in the construction of the symbolic meaning of our national icons.

And when it happened for the very first time, at Caroline\u2019s in New York, well, it was an out-of-body experience.\u201d Since that magic moment at Caroline\u2019s, which came at the conclusion of a stand-up comedy class he completed in December of 2010, Finoia has performed in lots of places and made lots of people laugh at him and his secrets. According to his website, www.mikefinoia.com, he\u2019s joked about everything from his \u201cchicken-stealing great-grandfather to his ex-fiancee and his own father\u2019s epic laziness.\u201d He\u2019s told his stories to everyone from the Gotham Comedy Club, the Cabaret at Mohegan Sun Casino, Comix at Foxwoods, to Joker\u2019s Wild in New Haven. And plenty of other places besides. His goal, he says, is to sign every green room wall from Maine to San Diego. Now New Haveners who might have missed him at Joker\u2019s Wild have a chance not only to see him perform this Saturday at Cafe Nine, but they can also have their own CD/DVD to enjoy the show again and again. He\u2019s doing the DVDs to help take his career to the next level, hoping that people attending will pass it along to friends who will also like it. \u201cI\u2019m proud of this material,\u201d he says, \u201cand I want to record it. It\u2019s a good snapshot of what I do. It may not ever end up on Comedy Central, but it\u2019s capturing this moment.\u201d Finoia, like a lot of comedians working today, started studying comedy from a very young age, long before he ever considered it a profession. He realized early on that making people laugh was a wonderful goal. He loves his grandfather, whom he describes as a \u201cbig, tough ironworker who could make any story into a funny one,\u201d and his father, who has a dry wit that capitalizes on pop culture references. Finoia, 32, who was raised in North Haven in a big Italian family, says he watched \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cNight at the Improv\u201d with his parents from the time he was really very little. \u201cI didn\u2019t get all the jokes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I got the rhythm of comedy. I could feel the math of comedy, the set-up, set-up, punchline that meant it was time to laugh. Jerry Seinfeld could be telling a joke in Chinese, and yet we would know when to laugh.\u201d Stand-up comedy was just an extension of what he said he\u2019d really been doing all his life. \u201cIt feels a bit like being a little kid in the deep end of the pool,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re holding on, scared of drowning, and then you just let go \u2014 and you go under, but you bob back up to the top and you\u2019re swimming. You\u2019re OK.

And when it happened for the very first time, at Caroline\u2019s in New York, well, it was an out-of-body experience.\u201d Since that magic moment at Caroline\u2019s, which came at the conclusion of a stand-up comedy class he completed in December of 2010, Finoia has performed in lots of places and made lots of people laugh at him and his secrets. According to his website, www.mikefinoia.com, he\u2019s joked about everything from his \u201cchicken-stealing great-grandfather to his ex-fiancee and his own father\u2019s epic laziness.\u201d He\u2019s told his stories to everyone from the Gotham Comedy Club, the Cabaret at Mohegan Sun Casino, Comix at Foxwoods, to Joker\u2019s Wild in New Haven. And plenty of other places besides. His goal, he says, is to sign every green room wall from Maine to San Diego. Now New Haveners who might have missed him at Joker\u2019s Wild have a chance not only to see him perform this Saturday at Cafe Nine, but they can also have their own CD/DVD to enjoy the show again and again. He\u2019s doing the DVDs to help take his career to the next level, hoping that people attending will pass it along to friends who will also like it. \u201cI\u2019m proud of this material,\u201d he says, \u201cand I want to record it. It\u2019s a good snapshot of what I do. It may not ever end up on Comedy Central, but it\u2019s capturing this moment.\u201d Finoia, like a lot of comedians working today, started studying comedy from a very young age, long before he ever considered it a profession. He realized early on that making people laugh was a wonderful goal. He loves his grandfather, whom he describes as a \u201cbig, tough ironworker who could make any story into a funny one,\u201d and his father, who has a dry wit that capitalizes on pop culture references. Finoia, 32, who was raised in North Haven in a big Italian family, says he watched \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cNight at the Improv\u201d with his parents from the time he was really very little. \u201cI didn\u2019t get all the jokes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I got the rhythm of comedy. I could feel the math of comedy, the set-up, set-up, punchline that meant it was time to laugh. Jerry Seinfeld could be telling a joke in Chinese, and yet we would know when to laugh.\u201d Stand-up comedy was just an extension of what he said he\u2019d really been doing all his life. \u201cIt feels a bit like being a little kid in the deep end of the pool,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re holding on, scared of drowning, and then you just let go \u2014 and you go under, but you bob back up to the top and you\u2019re swimming. You\u2019re OK. It\u2019s a liberating moment.\u201d The best moments are connecting the audience to those moments that everyone experiences, he says. \u201cEverybody thinks about the quirky things in their lives, and to have someone onstage talk about those things \u2014 well, it sparks something in them.

Three Sisters is Anton Chekhov's classic 1901 portrait of Russia's disappearing aristocratic class and their quest for meaning and fulfillment in the ever-changing modern world. Written in 1900 and first produced in 1901, Three Sisters was Chekhov's first specific commission for the Moscow Arts Theatre. A year after the death of their father, an army officer, the Moscow-bred Prosorovs, including the three sisters Olga, Masha, Irina, and one brother Andrew, are finding life drab and increasingly hopeless in a provincial Russian town. Only the proximity of a nearby artillery post and the company of its officers make their existence bearable. Each of the sisters is in pursuit of love and happiness, but both of these desires seem increasingly out of reach as the play progresses. The play has often been described as 'the decline of the aristocratic and artistic elite coupled with the search for meaning in a modern world.' Chekhov offers us the Prozorov siblings, who are refined and cultured youth, raised in Moscow but living a small and 'lifeless' provincial town for the past eleven years. With the recent death of their father Colonel Prozorov, they await a return to Moscow where the 'good life' can begin again.

Kids ages 9 to 16 are invited to ride either a 3 or 6 mile route to raise money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Jimmy Fund while their families cheer them on and enjoy the event. There will be a separate PMC Kids Jr. Ride for riders under the age of 9. To participate in the PMC Kids Jr. Ride, follow the same registration process. All registered riders will receive a PMC Kids t-shirt and water bottle. Over the past four years we raised over $100,000 and this year hope to raise more than $30,000. Registration: All registration must be done online by Friday, June 13th. To register just follow the link on the right side of the page. With your help, we look forward to making a significant contribution in 2015. Go to fundraising tips to learn more about what you can do to raise money for the fight against cancer. Throughout the day there will be music and activities including face painting, drawing, tattoos and field games. After the ride there will be a party with refreshments, music, and a rider fundraising recognition ceremony. Sponsorship opportunities are also encouraged at four levels: Cruiser ($100), Mountain ($250), Road ($500) and Racing ($1,000). All sponsors will be listed in the Sharon event program and sponsorships over $1,500 will be listed in the PMC yearbook. To sponsor the event, go to eGifts and enter the amount under general donation. Heavy Hitters: Each motivated rider who raises $250 or more will be honored as a PMC Kids Heavy Hitter. These PMC Kids Heavy Hitters will be recognized with a special PMC Kids Heavy Hitter baseball hat and other items to distinguish their achievement. Volunteers: Too old or can't ride? We could use as many volunteers as possible! Adults and teens 14+: to register to volunteer go to the right side of the page and click on register to volunteer. All Volunteers will receive a PMC t-shirt. Mission: The mission of PMC Sharon Kids Ride is to include young cyclists in the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC) mission of raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. The program engages youth in philanthropy and teaches them the value of working for the benefit of others. The ride also promotes athletic fitness and physical activity among youth.

There will be a separate PMC Kids Jr. Ride for riders under the age of 9. To participate in the PMC Kids Jr. Ride, follow the same registration process. All registered riders will receive a PMC Kids t-shirt and water bottle. Over the past four years we raised over $100,000 and this year hope to raise more than $30,000. Registration: All registration must be done online by Friday, June 13th. To register just follow the link on the right side of the page. With your help, we look forward to making a significant contribution in 2015. Go to fundraising tips to learn more about what you can do to raise money for the fight against cancer. Throughout the day there will be music and activities including face painting, drawing, tattoos and field games. After the ride there will be a party with refreshments, music, and a rider fundraising recognition ceremony. Sponsorship opportunities are also encouraged at four levels: Cruiser ($100), Mountain ($250), Road ($500) and Racing ($1,000). All sponsors will be listed in the Sharon event program and sponsorships over $1,500 will be listed in the PMC yearbook. To sponsor the event, go to eGifts and enter the amount under general donation. Heavy Hitters: Each motivated rider who raises $250 or more will be honored as a PMC Kids Heavy Hitter. These PMC Kids Heavy Hitters will be recognized with a special PMC Kids Heavy Hitter baseball hat and other items to distinguish their achievement. Volunteers: Too old or can't ride? We could use as many volunteers as possible! Adults and teens 14+: to register to volunteer go to the right side of the page and click on register to volunteer. All Volunteers will receive a PMC t-shirt. Mission: The mission of PMC Sharon Kids Ride is to include young cyclists in the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC) mission of raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. The program engages youth in philanthropy and teaches them the value of working for the benefit of others. The ride also promotes athletic fitness and physical activity among youth. The event will occur rain or shine - only a thunderstorm will cause a cancellation. See you there!

Tickets are on-sale at now! When the two Kentucky boys--Eddie, is from Lancaster and Troy is from Lexington--first burst onto the national scene in 1999 with the defiant 'Hillbilly Shoes' notice was served--country music had never seen a hard driving duo like this. Despite the millions of albums sold, the sold out shows and the scores of awards, Montgomery Gentry remains in touch with its working class roots. 'We are blue collar workers and we lived the songs that we sing,' says Troy. 'Because of that, our fans are able to make the connection and when they hear our songs, they know we are singing with passion and we know what we are talking about.' 'Unlike other awards, becoming members of the Grand Ole Opry is something people can't take away from you,' Troy says. 'Other awards come and go, but once you become a member of the Opry, you are a member for life--that's something that Eddie and I are very proud to be a part of.' There's no doubt that they're hard-running honky tonkers, but Eddie and Troy are also empathetic citizens of the world. Acknowledged by the Academy of Country Music as the 2010 winners of its Humanitarian Award, they devote their time and energy into making the needs of others a priority. They are active participants in many charitable organizations, including the U.S. military and numerous charitable organizations such as the TJ Martell Foundation, Camp Horsin' Around and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Middle Tennessee, among numerous others. Make no mistake about it: Montgomery Gentry has secured a place in musical history with a unique blend of country, southern rock and Everly Brothers-like harmonies combined with relatable lyrics. This is especially evident with their latest radio release, 'Headlights', from the highly anticipated album slated to be released in early 2015. With infectious lyrics and an anthem feel, this latest offering from the duo will have fans partying on tailgates well into the future.

The program engages youth in philanthropy, instills the value of working for the benefit of others, and promotes athletic fitness and physical activity. The PMC Kids Rides Program offers children, parents, and neighbors an opportunity to work together to create individual bike-a-thons in neighborhoods, at schools, or in business complexes. These rides enable children between the ages of 3 and 15 to ride their bikes and solicit sponsors to donate money to cancer research. The PMC Kids Ride gives us the opportunity to work together with the Franklin community and make a significant impact in the fight against cancer. We have all been touched in some way with someone who has had cancer. This ride gives children an opportunity to feel that they can make a difference. It empowers kids to become part of the Pan Mass Challenge (PMC) mission of raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. This ride also teaches children the value of riding for the benefit of others. Registration fee: $10 Required fundraising minimum: $25 Last year, our ride raised over $43,000 and this year, our goal is $50,000. Please help us reach this goal.

See all of Justine D.'s events \u00bb What/Why: PMC Kids Rides became an official PMC program in 2005 as a way to include young cyclists in the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge mission raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. The program engages youth in philanthropy, instills the value of working for the benefit of others, and promotes athletic fitness and physical activity. The PMC Kids Rides Program offers children, parents, and neighbors an opportunity to work together to create individual bike-a-thons in neighborhoods, at schools, or in business complexes. These rides enable children between the ages of 3 and 15 to ride their bikes and solicit sponsors to donate money to cancer research. The PMC Kids Ride gives us the opportunity to work together with the Franklin community and make a significant impact in the fight against cancer. We have all been touched in some way with someone who has had cancer. This ride gives children an opportunity to feel that they can make a difference. It empowers kids to become part of the Pan Mass Challenge (PMC) mission of raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. This ride also teaches children the value of riding for the benefit of others. Registration fee: $10 Required fundraising minimum: $25 Last year, our ride raised over $43,000 and this year, our goal is $50,000. Please help us reach this goal. Here are some ways you can help us: 1. \u00a0Make a Direct Donation 2. Sign up for our Ride: Choose your route and sign up now. Riders can choose 1 of four routes: Tikes & Trikes \u00a0(ages 3-6) - A supervised loop around parking lot for little ones and those on more than 2 wheels. 3 Miles 6Miles - challenging 10 Miles - more challenging with 2 hills The riders will set off on the back roads of Franklin in groups of 10.
