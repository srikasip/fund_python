|</td><td>Free</td><td>The Earth Harp is the largest stringed instrument on the planet. Part sculpture, part instrument, and part architecture, the sound it creates is nothing short of remarkable. Together with one of the most unique and breathtaking ensembles in the world, the Earth Harp Collective, inventor William Close pushes the envelope of the musical experience – making beautiful music with a massive physics machine. The long golden strings will be played by Close running rosin-covered gloves along the instrument, creating beautiful, cello like tones. Turning the Earth/landscape into a giant harp, her strings have stretched 1,000 feet to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, temples in Vietnam and the Colosseum in Rome. In another “first work” for the Festival, the iconic Superman Building becomes part of the instrument for an extraordinary musical performance. Three-days of celebration, including community “plays” with local students from FirstWorks Arts Learning, culminate in Festival concerts on Saturday, June 13. The Earth Harp is part of the Providence International Arts Festival June 11-14 put on by FirstWorks & the City of Providence.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441914574/earth-harp-artist-logo-sidebar_medium.jpg</td></tr>

<tr><td>Del's Lemonade Food Truck</td><td>Downtown Providence, ,</td><td>February 11, 2014 - Ongoing</td><td>February 11, 2014 - Ongoing</td><td>Great grandfather DeLucia made the earliest Del's Frozen Lemonade in 1840, in Naples, Italy. During the winter he carried snow into nearby caves and insulated it with straw. When summer arrived and the local lemons were ripe and flavorful, he mixed their juice with just the right amount of sugar and snow. Thus making a refreshing drink, which he sold at the local market. Fruit ices are popular in Europe, yet none is more loved than the product made from fresh lemon juice. Lemon ices produce the most delicious and thirst-quenching treat. Grandfather Franco DeLucia brought his father's frozen lemonade recipe to America at the turn of the century. Angelo DeLucia, his son, began work on a machine to produce the frozen lemonade, and on a method of making it a consistently excellent product. In 1948, Del's Frozen Lemonade acquired it's name and became the sole product sold at a little stand in Cranston, Rhode Island. Soon, Angelo had designed the first mobile units in order to serve anywhere in the state. When Angelo's son, Bruce, entered the family business there were 5 franchises in Rhode Island. Since then, Bruce has made the franchise business flourish and grow. Now, there are many Del's franchises worldwide providing the refreshing, all natural treat to everyone, anywhere, anytime.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/org/220185385/actnowri.com_foodtruck_delslemonade_medium.jpg</td></tr>
