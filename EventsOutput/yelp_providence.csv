Wellesley Summer Theatre Company Presents: Three Sisters	 ,Wellesley College, 106 Central Street
Wellesley
MA
02481	 Thursday, May 21, 2015 7:00 pm
Sunday, June 21, 2015 2:00 pm	 $10.00 - $20.00	 May 21-June 21. Thursday, Friday, Saturday 7:00 PM. Saturday and Sunday 2:00 PM.
Three Sisters is Anton Chekhov's classic 1901 portrait of Russia's disappearing aristocratic class and their quest for meaning and fulfillment in the ever-changing modern world. Written in 1900 and first produced in 1901, Three Sisters was Chekhov's first specific commission for the Moscow Arts Theatre.
A year after the death of their father, an army officer, the Moscow-bred Prosorovs, including the three sisters Olga, Masha, Irina, and one brother Andrew, are finding life drab and increasingly hopeless in a provincial Russian town. Only the proximity of a nearby artillery post and the company of its officers make their existence bearable. Each of the sisters is in pursuit of love and happiness, but both of these desires seem increasingly out of reach as the play progresses.
The play has often been described as "the decline of the aristocratic and artistic elite coupled with the search for meaning in a modern world." Chekhov offers us the Prozorov siblings, who are refined and cultured youth, raised in Moscow but living a small and "lifeless" provincial town for the past eleven years. With the recent death of their father Colonel Prozorov, they await a return to Moscow where the "good life" can begin again.
From its initial success to current productions, audiences have responded with enthusiasm to this beautiful collision of envisioned dreams and frustrated hopes as well as the memorable characters of the Prozorov family and their friends, lovers, and acquaintances who populate the stage (
).
Wellesley Summer Theatre Company productions are $20 general admission, $10 seniors/students.

4:00 pm	   	 Sampson's Automotive, LLC is pleased to host their 3rd Annual "ANCHOR DOWN" European Car Show on June 14, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The annual extravaganza expects to showcase over 250 cars and motorcycles of all makes and models. Local food vendors, refreshments, live music, and over 50-raffle prizes promise excitement for the whole family. Admission is only $5 for walk-in spectators, with plenty of parking outside the show. Proceeds to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. Anchor Down features Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, and other European brand names. American muscle cars, antiques and motorcycles are expected to join in the fun. The event takes place at Sampson's Automotive, 342 Compass Circle in North Kingstown.

Other passengers are asked to pay the $5 admission fee. Buddy's Hot Rod Dogs, Bravo Wood Fired, Del's Lemonade will be on hand with food and drink for over 2,500 attendees expected.
Brett Sampson, owner of Sampson's Auto, and his buddies grew up with a collective passion for cars. For years they attended four or more auto shows a year. At one point, many friends joined the armed forces and lost their camaraderie. Sampson kept thinking about all the fun they had, and dreamed of starting his own show. He found the Compass Circle property, and knew it would be a great venue. Sampson and his friends are all car enthusiasts. Launching the Anchor Down car show in 2013, they had 35 friends display their vehicles, with 77 in total. They combined their love of cars with their passion to help wounded veterans who return from deployment and need help. The first event raised $890, and donations more than tripled the following year.
All are invited to come enjoy an awesome day of fund¬raising for an important cause.

Sacred Firewalking Walk through life fearlessly...	 Sisters of Solace,700 American Legion Hwy
Westport
MA
02790	 Saturday, July 18, 2015 5:00 pm
10:00 pm	 $175.00	 Sacred Firewalking is a 5-hour transformational event designed to help you learn to walk through your life fearlessly. By learning how to walk on fire--literally.
Firewalking is an ancient sacred practice that has been present for centuries in cultures all around the world; with the oldest recorded firewalk occurring 4000 years ago.
The practice of firewalking is a powerful life-changing experience for self-realization and empowerment. It is direct physical proof of the mind-body connection that must be experienced to be truly understood.
During this life-changing experiential event you will learn to walk across hot coals and...
* Overcome fears
* Honor your intuition
* Release limiting beliefs
* Trust your internal guidance
* Shift from fear to confidence
* Discover that you are more powerful than you realized
Firewalking is entirely optional. Even if you chose not to firewalk, it is profoundly transformational to watch others cross the coals without being burned.	 http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/syNZt8kYeEmAPrhsosbP-g/ml.jpg
manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial	 Roger Williams National Memorial,282 N Main St
Providence
RI
02903	 Saturday, August 22, 2015 6:30 pm	 Free	 (Providence, RI) The Manton Avenue Project (MAP) is proud to announce that plays from their most recent festival, "This Land is Our Land: the public park plays," will be presented in a summer series as part of the 50th anniversary of the Roger Williams National Memorial.
Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. "This Land Is Our land" was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!
The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage.
"This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods," says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. "Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders."
This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's "Ticket to Ride" program.
The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/H1tnsLls7c6hOzZHGN1N2g/ml.jpg

Montgomery Gentry at Indian Ranch	 Indian Ranch,Rt 16
Webster
MA
01570	 Saturday, July 11, 2015 2:00 pm	 $24.50 - $56.50	 Indian Ranch is excited to have Montgomery Gentry at Indian Ranch, Saturday July 11 at 2:00 pm as part of their summer concert series. Tickets are on-sale at
now!
When the two Kentucky boys--Eddie, is from Lancaster and Troy is from Lexington--first burst onto the national scene in 1999 with the defiant "Hillbilly Shoes" notice was served--country music had never seen a hard driving duo like this.
Despite the millions of albums sold, the sold out shows and the scores of awards, Montgomery Gentry remains in touch with its working class roots. "We are blue collar workers and we lived the songs that we sing," says Troy. "Because of that, our fans are able to make the connection and when they hear our songs, they know we are singing with passion and we know what we are talking about."
"Unlike other awards, becoming members of the Grand Ole Opry is something people can't take away from you," Troy says. "Other awards come and go, but once you become a member of the Opry, you are a member for life--that's something that Eddie and I are very proud to be a part of."
There's no doubt that they're hard-running honky tonkers, but Eddie and Troy are also empathetic citizens of the world. Acknowledged by the Academy of Country Music as the 2010 winners of its Humanitarian Award, they devote their time and energy into making the needs of others a priority. They are active participants in many charitable organizations, including the U.S. military and numerous charitable organizations such as the TJ Martell Foundation, Camp Horsin' Around and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Middle Tennessee, among numerous others.
Make no mistake about it: Montgomery Gentry has secured a place in musical history with a unique blend of country, southern rock and Everly Brothers-like harmonies combined with relatable lyrics. This is especially evident with their latest radio release, "Headlights", from the highly anticipated album slated to be released in early 2015. With infectious lyrics and an anthem feel, this latest offering from the duo will have fans partying on tailgates well into the future.

manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial	 Roger Williams National Memorial,282 N Main St
Providence
RI
02903	 Saturday, June 20, 2015 6:30 pm	 Free	 (Providence, RI) The Manton Avenue Project (MAP) is proud to announce that plays from their most recent festival, "This Land is Our Land: the public park plays," will be presented in a summer series as part of the 50th anniversary of the Roger Williams National Memorial. Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. "This Land Is Our land" was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!
The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage.
"This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods," says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. "Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders."
This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's "Ticket to Ride" program.
The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/57wTzk-wFbsTJu-4in0aUg/ml.jpg

Franklin
MA
02038	 Today, June 14, 2015 8:00 am
12:00 pm	 $10.00 - $35.00	 PMC Kids Rides became an official PMC program in 2005 as a way to include young cyclists in the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge mission raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. The program engages youth in philanthropy, instills the value of working for the benefit of others, and promotes athletic fitness and physical activity.
The PMC Kids Rides Program offers children, parents, and neighbors an opportunity to work together to create individual bike-a-thons in neighborhoods, at schools, or in business complexes. These rides enable children between the ages of 3 and 15 to ride their bikes and solicit sponsors to donate money to cancer research.
The PMC Kids Ride gives us the opportunity to work together with the Franklin community and make a significant impact in the fight against cancer. We have all been touched in some way with someone who has had cancer. This ride gives children an opportunity to feel that they can make a difference. It empowers kids to become part of the Pan Mass Challenge (PMC) mission of raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. This ride also teaches children the value of riding for the benefit of others.
Registration fee: $10
Required fundraising minimum: $25
Last year, our ride raised over $43,000 and this year, our goal is $50,000. Please help us reach this goal.
Here are some ways you can help us:
1.  Make a Direct Donation
2. Sign up for our Ride:

With little fanfare, 'Redneck Crazy" was a #2 Billboard Country Album debut and an even more impressive Top 5 Billboard Top 200 Album debut.

manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial	 Roger Williams National Memorial,282 N Main St
Providence
RI
02903	 Saturday, July 11, 2015 6:30 pm	 Free	 (Providence, RI) The Manton Avenue Project (MAP) is proud to announce that plays from their most recent festival, "This Land is Our Land: the public park plays," will be presented in a summer series as part of the 50th anniversary of the Roger Williams National Memorial. Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. "This Land Is Our land" was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!
The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage.
"This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods," says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. "Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders."
This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's "Ticket to Ride" program.
The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/kuVxS6aew2hHp2LJBxT85w/ml.jpg
