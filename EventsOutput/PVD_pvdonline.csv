and Sunday	 	 The ART Drive returns to the South Coast on August 8-9, from 10 a.m-5 p.m. This year, 32 Dartmouth and Westport artists have teamed up for their eighth Open Studio weekend.

Some of the areaâs premier painters, ceramic artists, photographers, jewelers, woodworkers and others participate in this annual event. The ART Drive uniquely emphasizes a consistently high level of professionalism and quality in unusual and dramatic studio settings.

Each year, the participating artists apply their creativity and style to create large, colorful depictions of popular species of fish.  This year, they have chosen the bonito.  Each artist designs one of the approximately four-foot long âBodacious Bonitos,â which will be previewed in public spaces and in front of local shops, businesses and other sites in Dartmouth and Westport prior to the ART Drive weekend. The general public will be able to view and bid on the fish on eBay by going to www.the-art-drive.com.

The ART Drive artists individually donate a percentage of their sales to the Lloyd Center for the Environment.

Art lovers and collectors alike will enjoy a great day trip (or weekend escape) â touring these historic towns on Massachusettsâ South Coast. With only 15 miles separating the studios, visitors will enjoy a scenic drive through this picturesque area with ample time for a picnic lunch at the beach or dinner at one of the many area restaurants.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

Corey Manning from Nickelodeon!	 Comedy Connection
39 Warren Ave.
E. Providence, RI	 ,Fri.-Sat. 8pm	 	 Take a seat and put you drinks/food in location where you're less likely to knock them over, because as soon as Corey Manning descends upon the stage... It's on!!!

If there is no energy in the room, he brings it. If there IS energy in the room, Corey absorbs it, electrifies it, and then takes it to another level.

Featured in season one of Nick Jr.âs NickMom Night Out Comedy Showcase, Corey was the Winner of the World Series of Comedy East Coast Regional Satellite Competition at Goodnights Comedy Club in July of 2011, and out of 101 comedians he finished in the Top Eight in the WSOC Finals in Las Vegas. With a resume that includes performances in Jamie Foxx's LAFFAPALOOZA's New Faces In Comedy, headlining comedy clubs nationally, and touring with comedians such as Mo'Nique, Tracey Morgan, Bill Burr, Damon Wayans, Lavell Crawford, John Witherspoon, Bill Bellamy, and Bonnie MacFarlane; Corey is known for his "Slick, upbeat, funny, over-the-top comedy."

Corey has yet to find an audience he can't entertain, or a topic he can't cover. From discussing culture, college life, being a NCP (non-custodial parent), the positives and negatives of social media, relationships and his experience with "Girls Night Out", Corey can cover the most challenging topics, in a tasteful and insightful way. Although there is usually no filter or safety net to Corey's performance, upon request he can provide entertainment that is appropriate and/or can be tailored to any audiences.

So if you're ready for a laugh of a life time, call Corey Manning to your rescue. He is your Comedian By Night. Superhero = By Day. Saving the world, one smile at a time.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

224 Benefit Street
Providence, RI	 ,Tuesdays-Sundays, 10
am-5 pm. Thursdays,
10 am-9 pm	 	 The RISD Museum presents "Drawing Ambience: Alvin Boyarsky and the Architectural Association," highlighting the impressive collection of drawings assembled by Alvin Boyarsky during his pivotal tenure as chairman of the Architectural Association (AA) in London, from 1971 until his death in 1990. During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right.

"Drawing Ambience" features an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu. The drawings are complemented by a series of related folios published by the AA representing the work of Peter Cook, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Kisa Kawakami, among others. Together, these works provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore both the techniques and the imaginative spirit of drawing practices that permeated this time of change and experimentation in architecture worldwide.


"Drawing Ambience" is co-organized by the RISD Museum and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Washington University in St. Louis. It is accompanied by a fully illustrated 152-page catalogue. The exhibition opens at the Kemper Art Museum on September 12, 2014, and is on view at the RISD Museum from April 24 to August 2, 2015. "Drawing Ambience" is supported by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

July 23rd at 8pm & July 25th at 7pm

Written & directed by Frank V. Toti, Jr. from research & interviews by Steven Pennell
The play is performed by Cynthia Glinick and Steven Pennell with spoken word by Cody Suzuki as part of the 2nd Annual Providence Fringe Festival July 21-25, 2015.

What if your insides did not match other peopleâs perception of you? What if the world demanded you to be a person you were not? What if you lived in fear all the time?  Trans* is created from Oral History interviews of members of the local Trans* community in their own words.  The performance shares personal stories, raises issues and bears witness to the challenges of individuals struggling with Gender Identity.  Often maligned and misunderstood out of ignorance, these personal accounts illuminate individual journeys, help dispel fear and misunderstanding and celebrate courage and tenacity.

Ben Hague from CBS!	 Comedy Connection
39 Warren Ave.
E. Providence, 02914	 ,Fri.-Sat. 8pm	 	 Ben Hague is a stand up comedian, TV & radio personality, writer, and one of the hottest young talents on the comedy scene today. He is also the foremost aficionado of buffalo wings, and is an overall "good boy" according to his Nonnie.


At 21, after attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan, Ben moved to LA to pursue a career in comedy. He debuted his stand-up act at the world-famous comedy club Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, and never looked back. Since then he has been privileged to share the stage with such talents as Dane Cook, Dave Attel, Louis CK, Robert Klein, Jeffrey Ross, Gilbert Gottfried and many others.


Ben was a finalist in the Orange County "Laff Down" (2003) and Orange County "California's Funniest Person" two years running (2004, 2005). He won the "Catch A 'New' Rising Star" competition in his home state of Rhode Island in 2006. Ben has headlined at comedy clubs throughout the US, over 50 colleges nationally, and performed at the prestigious Fringe Festival in Scotland in 2011.


In 2009, Ben began his move into media by winning a hosting spot on FOX Providence's "The Rhode Show", beating out hundreds of other contestants. Ratings for the morning TV program immediately rose after he joined the team, and Ben became a staple on the show.


After his one year booking on "The Rhode Show" ended, he was immediately signed by the top morning radio show in New England, the "Giovanni and Kim Show" on 92.3 WPRO FM. The show is heard by over 300,000 listeners weekly. He also hosts many events and charities throughout the northeast, and of course is seen by thousands headlining on stages nationally. His debut recorded comedy album 'AVOID THE WET SPOT' is in the works for summer 2012. He currently lives in New York City and performs weekly at the top clubs in the city.


In his free time Ben enjoys all outdoor activities, is a huge new England sports fan, and can often be heard at bar's telling girls he wrote the screen plays for Mama Mia, and the Notebook.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

THE MACHINE, America's BEST Pink Floyd show, to perform "Unplugged" @ Greenwich Odeum on Sat, June 20th	 Greenwich Odeum
59 Main St
East Greenwich, RI	 ,8:00 PM	 	 THE MACHINE, Americaâs top Pink Floyd show, will perform "Unplugged" in the acoustic setting at Greenwich Odeum on Saturday, June 20th.  Showtime is 8:00 P.M.  Tickets are $35.00.  The venue is at 59 Main St, E. Greenwich, RI.

For more information call 401-885-4000.

Please check out this wonderful live review of their recent performance in Ocean City in Atlantic City Weekly:  http://tinyurl.com/lp8cdut

The Machine has forged a 25 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own. Over the years, The Machine has touched the hearts and souls of many, selling out theaters, large clubs and casinos across North and Central America, Europe and Asia. They have also appeared at renowned music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Riverbend, Gathering of the Vibes, Buffalo's Artpark, and Germanyâs Rock of Ages.

The New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for performing a diverse mix of The Floydâs extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of popular hits as well as obscure gems), The Machineâs stellar musicianship, dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest.

In the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even rivaling that of an early 1970âs Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980âs. The band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A to Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the alphabet.

Additionally, the quartet has been sharing the stage with full symphony orchestras, including the Atlanta, Detroit, Pittsburgh and San Diego Symphonies.

In 2004, Two Nights at the Keswick was released as a DVD/CD, archiving the bandâs bi-annual residency at this historic Philadelphia venue. Their next release, Unplugged (2006) captures a special acoustic performance at B.B. Kingâs in NYC featuring rare Syd Barrett solo material and deep cuts from early Floyd albums. Live In Amsterdam, a stunning concert DVD filmed at the Pepsi Stage, was released in August of 2008.

Band:
Adam Minkoff - Bass/Vocals
Scott Chasolen - Keys/Vocals
Ryan Ball - Guitar/Vocals
Tahrah Cohen - Drums


âThe Machine duplicates the sound and hits of Pink Floyd with chilling accuracy.â

âThe Machine sounds exactly like Pink Floydâ

âYou know youâve got it going on when you sell out B.B. Kingâs in New York City

His book Environmental Connection is a look back on a mindful year-long daily immersion into Nature, having been reviewed as "an easy and thought provoking read that marries genres in a way that speaks of a new generation of deep spiritual ecology; sort of the writings of John Muir and Leopold meet Awaken Healing Light of the Tao." Cowley will share reflections from his journals that showcase unique experiences and humbling encounters with local wildlife in their element and discuss how we can take responsibility for the maintenance of these environments through awareness and action, an initiative he outlines through New-Native Foundation. Books will be available for purchase and signing. The event is free and open to the public.

Frequency Teen Workshops	 Frequency
186 Carpenter
Providence, Rhode Island	 ,10 am - 12 pm	 	 A month-long workshop for teens: Part 1: A New Spelling of My Name and Part 2: Invisible Cities
Part 1: A New Spelling of My Name
Who gave us our names? How does society define us? How do we begin to name and define ourselves? Part 1 of this course leads participants through a series of prompts, games, and exercises centered around identity, selfhood, and power. Weâll rant and rave, question and critique, experiment and play.
Part 2: Invisible Cities
What if you were in charge of everything in the world? In this portion of the class, youâll design a society, community or culture and write a story about it or a plan for building it. Weâll also read about and discuss deliberately constructed societies, both fictional ones and ones that people have really tried to make and live inâsome science fiction, some proposals, some real-life documents. What do societies or communities need in order to function? To function well? What can we learn about our own world by inventing others, and by looking at worlds that other people have invented and tried to build? The class will include some full-group and small-group discussions and activities to think about the reading, develop your design for âyourâ society, and help you write your story or plan.

Early Exposures: 19th-Century Photography from the Collection	 RISD Museum
224 Benefit Street
Providence, RI	 ,Tuesdays-Sundays, 10
am-5 pm. Thursdays,
10 am-9 pm.	 	 More than 20 images from the RISD Museumâs collection of rare and seldom seen 19th-century photographs investigate a range of themesâfrom majestic natural wonders to documents of the urban poorâall captured before the invention of hand-held cameras. Photography emerged almost simultaneously in France and England in the late 1830s, and its first century saw intensive experimentation with image capture, printing techniques, and camera design. A boom in photographic portraiture produced untold numbers of cartes de visite, daguerreotypes, tintypes, and other short-lived formats made as keepsakes and family heirlooms.

Photographic documentation developed into more of an art form as aesthetic considerations were brought to subjects as diverse as Adolphe Braunâs designs for textiles and Julia Margaret Cameronâs allegorical portraits, with results ranging from strikingly sharp views to softly focused and deeply soulful forays into mood and spirituality.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

Be A Man Film Screening	 Avon
260 Thayer Street
Providence, RI	 ,4pm	 	 Be A Man is a documentary feature film that follows comedian Ray Harrington on his journey to discover what it means to be a Modern Man before the birth of his son.
What does it mean to be a man? Comedian Ray Harrington has struggled with that question all of his life. Like many, he was raised by a single mother without any male influences to guide his awkward stumble into manhood. Now with a baby on the way, Ray realizes that before he can be a father, he needs to know what it means to be a man. Be A Man is a personal and heartwarming look at one manâs struggle to find his place in the world. Often laugh out loud funny, the film is wonderfully touching as Ray and his film crew welcome the viewer in as another friend on the journey of examining manliness and masculinity in modern culture.

Along the way, Ray asks for advice and help from fellow comedians and experts in their fields. Kyle Kinane, Bobby Kelly, Steve Rannazzisi, Doug Stanhope, and more all share their views on what it means to be a man. Ray steps into the ring to face 5 time world champion, Vinny Pazienza. Heâll also discover his signature drink, give himself a classic straight razor shave, hunt down his very rare dream car, and face a jury of women to find out if he can be the man that movies and television had always told him he should be.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

186 Carpenter
Providence, Rhode Island	 ,6:30-9:00 pm	 	 Everybodyâs Autobiography: A six-week prose workshop
During our six weeks together, we will engage in a rather unconventional exploration of what it means to write about a life, whether someone elseâs or oneâs own. We will read a number of biographical and autobiographical texts that play with questions of form and objectivity. And using ârealâ materials drawn from someoneâs lifeâbe it letters, journals, interview responses, voice recordings, etc.âwe will write our own, which later we will workshop during class. A willingness to engage closely with assigned readings and to experiment when working on oneâs own is expected. We should be ready to take risks, ready to put in the necessary work, and ready to enjoy the process.

The Manton Avenue Projectâs (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAPâs out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kidsâ voices to the stage.

âThis Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where weâve discussed the importance of public parks in our lives â what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,â says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. âOur goal is to bring kidsâ voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrowâs creative thinkers and community leaders.â

This program is supported by the National Park Foundationâs âTicket to Rideâ program.

The Manton Avenue Projectâs 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

GENERAL STANTON INN FLEA MARKET SEEKS 50 NEW VENDORS IN CELEBRATION OF ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY	 The General Stanton Inn Flea Market
4115 Old Post Road
Charlestown, RI	 ,8 a.m.-4p.m. every
Saturday, Sunday and
Holiday Monday,
through Columbus Day	 	 In honor of its 50th Anniversary Season, organizers at  Charlestown's General Stanton Inn Flea Market, are hoping to add 50 new vendors to its ranks of sellers, who return season after season to market their wares at the outdoor, weekend Flea Market, from late April through mid-October.
The General Stanton Flea Market features booths selling antiques, collectibles, new and boutique items, crafts, art and Farmers' Market merchandise.  According to Janice Falcone, who has owned and operated both the Inn and the Flea Market since 1973, people selling local produce, plants, vegetables and other Farmers' Market items, have added a desired new dimension to the Flea Market during the last few seasons.

"Well, let's say they give us a "fresh" look, Falcone quips. "Tomato and basil plants, bright flowers, delicious mid-summer fruits and vegetables and  jams--they all seem quite at home among the wooden kitchen tools, hand-woven baskets and and all the other farmhouse antiques and collectibles sold here each week."

"We'd also like to see a wider variety of "home-grown" crafts for sale this year. On a peak Summer Sunday, we can get 1,000 to 2,000 folks out here browsing and buying-- and many of them are from different states and different countries.  Many are hoping to head home with something handmade from this area--a real souvenir from Rhode Island. Perhaps some of the on-line sellers around here, might want to take a break this summer and set up here. There's no better--or more fun-- place to spend some "face-time" than at a Flea Market!"

The octogenarian Ms. Falcone also hopes to attract a few more food trucks to Charlestown over the next six months.

"In past seasons, the aroma of that popping Kettle Korn and the puckering, refreshing taste of Del's Lemonade have added to the festive feel at our Flea Market. Yet to be able to grab a Greek salad or a fish taco here at the Flea Market, would be something else, altogether..."

10 x 20-feet booths are available at rates ranging from $20.-$35, depending on the location. Selling areas are available against the fence, on the grass and in pre-tarped rows. Vendors need to supply their own tables, chairs and sunbrellas, if they are not choosing a booth under the pre-tarped sections of the Market.  The Flea Market is set among the seven, tree-lined acres that make up the property of  the historic, General Joseph Stanton Inn, which was established in 1667.  It is one of the oldest inns in the country and was once a regular coach stop between Providence and New London.. It is located at 4115 Old Post Road in Charlestown, 02813.

The General Stanton Inn Flea Market also welcomes what Ms. Falcone refers to as "instant tag sales."

"We love our full-Season vendors, yet if you just want to set up your own, one-time, tag sale right here, we're fine with that. Why not take advantage of our built-in publicity and ever-expanding customer base, and clear out your cottage and garage of things someone else can use?"

Ms. Falcone is especially proud of the Flea Market's role in the  community.  All non-profit organizations are invited to set up sales and/or informational booths at the Flea Market on any weekend, free of charge.

"We're also Charlestown's 'cracker barrel,' where neighbors come to meet and greet and exchange town and beach news. I can't tell you how many times someone has stopped me while I'm buzzing around the market on my motorized cart, and asked me if I've seen 'so-and-so' that day.  And more often than not, I have."

The General Stanton Inn Flea Market is now open Saturdays, Sundays and Holiday Mondays through Columbus Day, 8 a.m.-4p.m.  (Since late April, it has been open on Sundays only.)

For further information or to reserve a vendor space, call Janice Falcone at 401-364-1818 or 401-364-8888.  http://www.generalstantoninn.com

HAO NI | Ghost Hit Wall	 Yellow Peril Gallery
60 Valley St #5
Providence, RI	 ,Opening: June 13,
6PM - 9PM	 	 Yellow Peril Gallery is pleased to present âGhost Hit Wallâ by Hao Ni, featuring an eclectic series of video, mixed media installations, sculptures, and drawings from June 11 â July 19, 2015. The opening reception is Saturday, June 13 from 6PM â 9PM.

âGhost Hit Wallâ is the literal translation of âé¬¼æçâ, the Mandarin Chinese expression of getting lost, going in a circle and not being able to get out. âThe idea is that when traveling in remote areas, a person is obstructed by walls that ghosts have placed in front of them, thus forcing that person to wander in endless circles,â says Ni. âPeople also use this term to describe problems with no real solution.â

The works featured in âGhost Hit Wallâ are infused with visual information that encourages viewers to contemplate what it is like to get lost in the various shapes, patterns, words and clues on display. Through organizing, manipulating, repeating, and translating everyday objects and scenarios, the exhibition excavates the different material layers in life to examine the tension, dread and uncertainty under the duress of continuously accelerating time.

The opening reception for âGhost Hit Wallâ is Saturday, June 13, from 6PM â 9PM. The exhibition will be on display until Sunday, July 19, 2015. This is Hao Niâs second solo exhibition at Yellow Peril Gallery. The first was âProximityâ in 2013.

About Hao NI
HAO NI was born in 1989 in Hsin Chu, Taiwan. He received his MFA in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2014. He has exhibited his work in group and solo shows in Providence, New York, Chicago, Miami, and Taipei, including venues like Taipei Fine Arts Museum in Taiwan, Queens Museum in New York, and New Bedford Art Museum in Massachusetts.
