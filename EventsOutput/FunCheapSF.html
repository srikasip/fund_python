<tr><td>Film Screening: Last Days In Vietnam | SF</td><td>Presidio Officers’ Club,| Moraga Ave. and Graham St., San Francisco, CA</td><td>Thursday, June 18, 2015,- 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm</td><td>| Cost:,</td><td>Join us for a special screening of the documentary film Last Days in Vietnam, highlighting the tense and chaotic final days of the war. In April 1975, the North Vietnamese Army closed in on Saigon, and South Vietnamese resistance crumbled. As cities and villages fell to the North, the few U.S. diplomats and military operatives who remained in the country contemplated withdrawal. With the lives of thousands of South Vietnamese hanging in the balance, those in control faced an impossible choice––who would go and who would be left behind to face brutality, imprisonment, or death.
Directed by Rory Kennedy, this Academy Award® nominated documentary premiers on PBS in April in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.
Hosted in partnership with KQED.</td><td>http://sf.funcheap.com</td></tr>
