Working as a Creative Partner in the Providence International Arts Festival, it will bring the Washington Street Cultural Corridor to life with murals, art installations, interactive expressions of creativity, and a pop-up skate and art park. Internationally noted street artists Etam Cru and Natalia Rak will also be exhibiting their unique and flamboyant visual styles through new works here in the Creative Capital. Rak’s large-scale works depicting femininity and nature in bold, colorful juxtapositions have graced walls in Hawaii, Sweden and Italy, and she has staged “Art Battles” in New York City’s Bryant Park. Polish duo Etam Cru (street artists Sainer and Bezt) creates giant murals, often several stories tall, that are steeped in folklore and mysticism throughout eastern Europe, as well as in Portugal and the U.S. Throughout the festival, The Avenue Concept’s art work and programming will foster a conversation about the role of art in the public space, and the way creative expression is instrumental in making a city vibrant and inclusive. The Avenue Concept is part of the Providence International Arts Festival June 11-14 put on by FirstWorks & the City of Providence.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441914552/avenue-concept-artist-logo-sidebar_medium.jpg</td></tr>

<tr><td>Providence International Arts Festival: The Earth Harp</td><td>Greater Kennedy Plaza,2 Kennedy Plaza,Providence, RI 02903</td><td>Jun 14, 2015  at 12:00 pm (Sun)


|</td><td>Free</td><td>The Earth Harp is the largest stringed instrument on the planet. Part sculpture, part instrument, and part architecture, the sound it creates is nothing short of remarkable. Together with one of the most unique and breathtaking ensembles in the world, the Earth Harp Collective, inventor William Close pushes the envelope of the musical experience – making beautiful music with a massive physics machine. The long golden strings will be played by Close running rosin-covered gloves along the instrument, creating beautiful, cello like tones. Turning the Earth/landscape into a giant harp, her strings have stretched 1,000 feet to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, temples in Vietnam and the Colosseum in Rome. In another “first work” for the Festival, the iconic Superman Building becomes part of the instrument for an extraordinary musical performance. Three-days of celebration, including community “plays” with local students from FirstWorks Arts Learning, culminate in Festival concerts on Saturday, June 13. The Earth Harp is part of the Providence International Arts Festival June 11-14 put on by FirstWorks & the City of Providence.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441914574/earth-harp-artist-logo-sidebar_medium.jpg</td></tr>

The play was included in the First Folio, published in 1623. Much Ado About Nothing is generally considered one of Shakespeare's best comedies, because it combines elements of robust hilarity with more serious meditations on honor, shame, and court politics. By means of "noting" (which, in Shakespeare's day, sounded the same as "nothing," and which is gossip, rumour, and overhearing), Benedick and Beatrice are tricked into confessing their love for each other, and Claudio is tricked into rejecting Hero at the altar on the erroneous belief that she has been unfaithful. At the end, Benedick and Beatrice join forces to set things right, and the others join in a dance celebrating the marriages of the two couples.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441922726/much-ado-580x244_medium.jpg</td></tr>

<tr><td>James Montgomery</td><td>Courthouse Center for the Arts,3481 Kingstown Rd.,West Kingston, RI 02892</td><td>Jun 19, 2015  at 8:00 pm (Fri)</td><td>$25</td><td>When blues legend James Montgomery plays the harmonica, he "brings it on home". Whether it's recording with Kid Rock, sitting in with Gregg Allman, or fronting his hot band of thirty years, Montgomery plays with authority. While growing up in Detroit he learned first-hand from the masters - James Cotton, John Lee Hooker, and Jr. Wells - at the legendary "Chessmate." Over the years, he's carried on in the tradition and continues to be a vital presence in Blues as one of the most dynamic performers on the scene. "the John Mayall of New England" Peter Wolf In 1970, while attending Boston University, Montgomery formed the James Montgomery Band. His inimitable (oh yeah, he majored in English) harmonica playing combined with his incredibly energetic live shows led to the band's quick ascension on the New England music scene. Within two years, the James Montgomery band was among the hottest acts in Boston along with J. Geils and Aerosmith, and they were quickly signed to a multi-album deal with Capricorn Records. Since that time, James has recorded six albums. His first, "First Time Out" has been remastered and re-released by MRG/Capricorn. Other include "James Montgomery Band" on Island Records which was number nine on Billboard's national playlist, "Duck Fever" with members of the David Letterman Band, "Live Trax," with the Uptown Horns (the Rolling Stones' horn section), and his release on Tone-Cool, "The Oven Is On."</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/org/220159857/aa_medium.png</td></tr>

Fiberglass Teddy Bear (2004), an enormous stuffed pink bear visible through the windows of List Art Building, appears like a charmingly silly commemoration of youthful innocence. What, after all, is more emblematic of uncorrupted childhood than a teddy bear? Likewise, Baby Blanket (2002), a white swaddling cloth encased in a glass vitrine, sits like a perfectly preserved relic. However, close inspection of either of these objects quickly reveals how monstrous they actually are. Both are knit from materials laden with tiny shards of glass, making them abhorrent to the touch and dangerous to the lungs: the bear from Owens Corning Fiberglas (typically used for home insulation) and the blanket from Fiberfrax (an industrial porcelain developed to replace asbestos). Throughout his practice, Dave Cole juxtaposes such hazardous materials with the nostalgia of childhood to elucidate tensions between the ideal and the real.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441912930/dc_exhibition_01_medium.jpg</td></tr>

Soapstone is the easiest of all stones to carve and offers the satisfying challenge of working in the round on an intimate scale. It is one of the best ways to learn reductive sculpture techniques and is suitable for beginners, yet the beauty of the stone and the finishes that can be achieved make it interesting for the more advanced student as well. Looking at the artwork of Native American carvers and some monumental modernist sculptors provides inspiration and focus for the wonderful, flowing forms students can achieve. Using saws, files, rasps and chisels, participants should be able to complete one small carving in three days. This is a wonderful opportunity for those who have never carved, and even for those who have. Please come with several ideas, sketches or visual references, if possible, so that we can begin carving immediately.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441922231/100_1085_medium.jpg</td></tr>

As a gesture of kindness, Newport officials organized an illumination, requiring residents to light candles in their windows at dusk to welcome their new allies. For those who could not afford candles, they were provided.</td><td>http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441921233/french_event_low_res_photo_medium.jpg</td></tr>

|</td><td>FREE</td><td>Yellow Peril Gallery is pleased to present “Ghost Hit Wall” by Hao Ni, featuring an eclectic series of video, mixed media installations, sculptures, and drawings.

“Ghost Hit Wall” is the literal translation of “???”, the Mandarin Chinese expression of getting lost, going in a circle and not being able to get out. “The idea is that when traveling in remote areas, a person is obstructed by walls that ghosts have placed in front of them, thus forcing that person to wander in endless circles,” says Ni. “People also use this term to describe problems with no real solution.”

The works featured in “Ghost Hit Wall” are infused with visual information that encourages viewers to contemplate what it is like to get lost in the various shapes, patterns, words and clues on display. Through organizing, manipulating, repeating, and translating everyday objects and scenarios, the exhibition excavates the different material layers in life to examine the tension, dread and uncertainty under the duress of continuously accelerating time.

This is Hao Ni’s second solo exhibition at Yellow Peril Gallery. The first was “Proximity” in 2013.
