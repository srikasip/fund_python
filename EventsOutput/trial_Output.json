If there is no energy in the room, he brings it. If there IS energy in the room, Corey absorbs it, electrifies it, and then takes it to another level.  Featured in season one of Nick Jr.âs NickMom Night Out Comedy Showcase, Corey was the Winner of the World Series of Comedy East Coast Regional Satellite Competition at Goodnights Comedy Club in July of 2011, and out of 101 comedians he finished in the Top Eight in the WSOC Finals in Las Vegas. With a resume that includes performances in Jamie Foxx's LAFFAPALOOZA's New Faces In Comedy, headlining comedy clubs nationally, and touring with comedians such as Mo'Nique, Tracey Morgan, Bill Burr, Damon Wayans, Lavell Crawford, John Witherspoon, Bill Bellamy, and Bonnie MacFarlane; Corey is known for his 'Slick, upbeat, funny, over-the-top comedy.'  Corey has yet to find an audience he can't entertain, or a topic he can't cover. From discussing culture, college life, being a NCP (non-custodial parent), the positives and negatives of social media, relationships and his experience with 'Girls Night Out', Corey can cover the most challenging topics, in a tasteful and insightful way. Although there is usually no filter or safety net to Corey's performance, upon request he can provide entertainment that is appropriate and/or can be tailored to any audiences.

During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right.  'Drawing Ambience' features an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu. The drawings are complemented by a series of related folios published by the AA representing the work of Peter Cook, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Kisa Kawakami, among others. Together, these works provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore both the techniques and the imaginative spirit of drawing practices that permeated this time of change and experimentation in architecture worldwide.   'Drawing Ambience' is co-organized by the RISD Museum and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Washington University in St. Louis. It is accompanied by a fully illustrated 152-page catalogue. The exhibition opens at the Kemper Art Museum on September 12, 2014, and is on view at the RISD Museum from April 24 to August 2, 2015. 'Drawing Ambience' is supported by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.","datetime":",Tuesdays-Sundays, 10 am-5 pm.
