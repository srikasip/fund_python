and Sunday	 	 The ART Drive returns to the South Coast on August 8-9, from 10 a.m-5 p.m. This year, 32 Dartmouth and Westport artists have teamed up for their eighth Open Studio weekend.

Some of the areaâs premier painters, ceramic artists, photographers, jewelers, woodworkers and others participate in this annual event. The ART Drive uniquely emphasizes a consistently high level of professionalism and quality in unusual and dramatic studio settings.

Each year, the participating artists apply their creativity and style to create large, colorful depictions of popular species of fish.  This year, they have chosen the bonito.  Each artist designs one of the approximately four-foot long âBodacious Bonitos,â which will be previewed in public spaces and in front of local shops, businesses and other sites in Dartmouth and Westport prior to the ART Drive weekend. The general public will be able to view and bid on the fish on eBay by going to www.the-art-drive.com.

The ART Drive artists individually donate a percentage of their sales to the Lloyd Center for the Environment.

Art lovers and collectors alike will enjoy a great day trip (or weekend escape) â touring these historic towns on Massachusettsâ South Coast. With only 15 miles separating the studios, visitors will enjoy a scenic drive through this picturesque area with ample time for a picnic lunch at the beach or dinner at one of the many area restaurants.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

Corey Manning from Nickelodeon!	 Comedy Connection
39 Warren Ave.
E. Providence, RI	 ,Fri.-Sat. 8pm	 	 Take a seat and put you drinks/food in location where you're less likely to knock them over, because as soon as Corey Manning descends upon the stage... It's on!!!

If there is no energy in the room, he brings it. If there IS energy in the room, Corey absorbs it, electrifies it, and then takes it to another level.

Featured in season one of Nick Jr.âs NickMom Night Out Comedy Showcase, Corey was the Winner of the World Series of Comedy East Coast Regional Satellite Competition at Goodnights Comedy Club in July of 2011, and out of 101 comedians he finished in the Top Eight in the WSOC Finals in Las Vegas. With a resume that includes performances in Jamie Foxx's LAFFAPALOOZA's New Faces In Comedy, headlining comedy clubs nationally, and touring with comedians such as Mo'Nique, Tracey Morgan, Bill Burr, Damon Wayans, Lavell Crawford, John Witherspoon, Bill Bellamy, and Bonnie MacFarlane; Corey is known for his "Slick, upbeat, funny, over-the-top comedy."

Corey has yet to find an audience he can't entertain, or a topic he can't cover. From discussing culture, college life, being a NCP (non-custodial parent), the positives and negatives of social media, relationships and his experience with "Girls Night Out", Corey can cover the most challenging topics, in a tasteful and insightful way. Although there is usually no filter or safety net to Corey's performance, upon request he can provide entertainment that is appropriate and/or can be tailored to any audiences.

So if you're ready for a laugh of a life time, call Corey Manning to your rescue. He is your Comedian By Night. Superhero = By Day. Saving the world, one smile at a time.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

224 Benefit Street
Providence, RI	 ,Tuesdays-Sundays, 10
am-5 pm. Thursdays,
10 am-9 pm	 	 The RISD Museum presents "Drawing Ambience: Alvin Boyarsky and the Architectural Association," highlighting the impressive collection of drawings assembled by Alvin Boyarsky during his pivotal tenure as chairman of the Architectural Association (AA) in London, from 1971 until his death in 1990. During his time leading the school, Boyarsky orchestrated an ambitious exhibition and publication program that situated drawing as not only a representational tool, but as a form of architecture in its own right.

"Drawing Ambience" features an iconic group of drawings by some of the most prominent architects and artists of our time, including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind, Mary Miss, OMA-Rem Koolhaas, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Tschumi, and Shin Takamatsu. The drawings are complemented by a series of related folios published by the AA representing the work of Peter Cook, Peter Eisenman, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Kisa Kawakami, among others. Together, these works provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore both the techniques and the imaginative spirit of drawing practices that permeated this time of change and experimentation in architecture worldwide.


"Drawing Ambience" is co-organized by the RISD Museum and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Washington University in St. Louis. It is accompanied by a fully illustrated 152-page catalogue. The exhibition opens at the Kemper Art Museum on September 12, 2014, and is on view at the RISD Museum from April 24 to August 2, 2015. "Drawing Ambience" is supported by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

July 23rd at 8pm & July 25th at 7pm

Written & directed by Frank V. Toti, Jr. from research & interviews by Steven Pennell
The play is performed by Cynthia Glinick and Steven Pennell with spoken word by Cody Suzuki as part of the 2nd Annual Providence Fringe Festival July 21-25, 2015.

What if your insides did not match other peopleâs perception of you? What if the world demanded you to be a person you were not? What if you lived in fear all the time?  Trans* is created from Oral History interviews of members of the local Trans* community in their own words.  The performance shares personal stories, raises issues and bears witness to the challenges of individuals struggling with Gender Identity.  Often maligned and misunderstood out of ignorance, these personal accounts illuminate individual journeys, help dispel fear and misunderstanding and celebrate courage and tenacity.

Ben Hague from CBS!	 Comedy Connection
39 Warren Ave.
E. Providence, 02914	 ,Fri.-Sat. 8pm	 	 Ben Hague is a stand up comedian, TV & radio personality, writer, and one of the hottest young talents on the comedy scene today. He is also the foremost aficionado of buffalo wings, and is an overall "good boy" according to his Nonnie.


At 21, after attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan, Ben moved to LA to pursue a career in comedy. He debuted his stand-up act at the world-famous comedy club Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, and never looked back. Since then he has been privileged to share the stage with such talents as Dane Cook, Dave Attel, Louis CK, Robert Klein, Jeffrey Ross, Gilbert Gottfried and many others.


Ben was a finalist in the Orange County "Laff Down" (2003) and Orange County "California's Funniest Person" two years running (2004, 2005). He won the "Catch A 'New' Rising Star" competition in his home state of Rhode Island in 2006. Ben has headlined at comedy clubs throughout the US, over 50 colleges nationally, and performed at the prestigious Fringe Festival in Scotland in 2011.


In 2009, Ben began his move into media by winning a hosting spot on FOX Providence's "The Rhode Show", beating out hundreds of other contestants. Ratings for the morning TV program immediately rose after he joined the team, and Ben became a staple on the show.


After his one year booking on "The Rhode Show" ended, he was immediately signed by the top morning radio show in New England, the "Giovanni and Kim Show" on 92.3 WPRO FM. The show is heard by over 300,000 listeners weekly. He also hosts many events and charities throughout the northeast, and of course is seen by thousands headlining on stages nationally. His debut recorded comedy album 'AVOID THE WET SPOT' is in the works for summer 2012. He currently lives in New York City and performs weekly at the top clubs in the city.


In his free time Ben enjoys all outdoor activities, is a huge new England sports fan, and can often be heard at bar's telling girls he wrote the screen plays for Mama Mia, and the Notebook.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

THE MACHINE, America's BEST Pink Floyd show, to perform "Unplugged" @ Greenwich Odeum on Sat, June 20th	 Greenwich Odeum
59 Main St
East Greenwich, RI	 ,8:00 PM	 	 THE MACHINE, Americaâs top Pink Floyd show, will perform "Unplugged" in the acoustic setting at Greenwich Odeum on Saturday, June 20th.  Showtime is 8:00 P.M.  Tickets are $35.00.  The venue is at 59 Main St, E. Greenwich, RI.

For more information call 401-885-4000.

Please check out this wonderful live review of their recent performance in Ocean City in Atlantic City Weekly:  http://tinyurl.com/lp8cdut

The Machine has forged a 25 year reputation of excellence, extending the legacy of Pink Floyd, while creating another legacy all their own. Over the years, The Machine has touched the hearts and souls of many, selling out theaters, large clubs and casinos across North and Central America, Europe and Asia. They have also appeared at renowned music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Riverbend, Gathering of the Vibes, Buffalo's Artpark, and Germanyâs Rock of Ages.

The New York based band focuses on making every show an authentic Floydian experience for their fans. Known for performing a diverse mix of The Floydâs extensive 16-album repertoire (complete with faithful renditions of popular hits as well as obscure gems), The Machineâs stellar musicianship, dramatic lighting and video, and their passionate delivery sets them above and beyond the rest.

In the classic tradition, The Machine explores collective improvisation paralleling and even rivaling that of an early 1970âs Pink Floyd mentality. Their use of expanded theatrical elements and elaborate stage displays continues in the spirit of the later Floyd lineups of the 1980âs. The band is also known for recreating entire albums as a part of their show, accepting requests from fans, and for taking an A to Z approach in which one song is played for every letter of the alphabet.

Additionally, the quartet has been sharing the stage with full symphony orchestras, including the Atlanta, Detroit, Pittsburgh and San Diego Symphonies.

In 2004, Two Nights at the Keswick was released as a DVD/CD, archiving the bandâs bi-annual residency at this historic Philadelphia venue. Their next release, Unplugged (2006) captures a special acoustic performance at B.B. Kingâs in NYC featuring rare Syd Barrett solo material and deep cuts from early Floyd albums. Live In Amsterdam, a stunning concert DVD filmed at the Pepsi Stage, was released in August of 2008.

Band:
Adam Minkoff - Bass/Vocals
Scott Chasolen - Keys/Vocals
Ryan Ball - Guitar/Vocals
Tahrah Cohen - Drums


âThe Machine duplicates the sound and hits of Pink Floyd with chilling accuracy.â

âThe Machine sounds exactly like Pink Floydâ

âYou know youâve got it going on when you sell out B.B. Kingâs in New York City

His book Environmental Connection is a look back on a mindful year-long daily immersion into Nature, having been reviewed as "an easy and thought provoking read that marries genres in a way that speaks of a new generation of deep spiritual ecology; sort of the writings of John Muir and Leopold meet Awaken Healing Light of the Tao." Cowley will share reflections from his journals that showcase unique experiences and humbling encounters with local wildlife in their element and discuss how we can take responsibility for the maintenance of these environments through awareness and action, an initiative he outlines through New-Native Foundation. Books will be available for purchase and signing. The event is free and open to the public.

Frequency Teen Workshops	 Frequency
186 Carpenter
Providence, Rhode Island	 ,10 am - 12 pm	 	 A month-long workshop for teens: Part 1: A New Spelling of My Name and Part 2: Invisible Cities
Part 1: A New Spelling of My Name
Who gave us our names? How does society define us? How do we begin to name and define ourselves? Part 1 of this course leads participants through a series of prompts, games, and exercises centered around identity, selfhood, and power. Weâll rant and rave, question and critique, experiment and play.
Part 2: Invisible Cities
What if you were in charge of everything in the world? In this portion of the class, youâll design a society, community or culture and write a story about it or a plan for building it. Weâll also read about and discuss deliberately constructed societies, both fictional ones and ones that people have really tried to make and live inâsome science fiction, some proposals, some real-life documents. What do societies or communities need in order to function? To function well? What can we learn about our own world by inventing others, and by looking at worlds that other people have invented and tried to build? The class will include some full-group and small-group discussions and activities to think about the reading, develop your design for âyourâ society, and help you write your story or plan.

Early Exposures: 19th-Century Photography from the Collection	 RISD Museum
224 Benefit Street
Providence, RI	 ,Tuesdays-Sundays, 10
am-5 pm. Thursdays,
10 am-9 pm.	 	 More than 20 images from the RISD Museumâs collection of rare and seldom seen 19th-century photographs investigate a range of themesâfrom majestic natural wonders to documents of the urban poorâall captured before the invention of hand-held cameras. Photography emerged almost simultaneously in France and England in the late 1830s, and its first century saw intensive experimentation with image capture, printing techniques, and camera design. A boom in photographic portraiture produced untold numbers of cartes de visite, daguerreotypes, tintypes, and other short-lived formats made as keepsakes and family heirlooms.

Photographic documentation developed into more of an art form as aesthetic considerations were brought to subjects as diverse as Adolphe Braunâs designs for textiles and Julia Margaret Cameronâs allegorical portraits, with results ranging from strikingly sharp views to softly focused and deeply soulful forays into mood and spirituality.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

Be A Man Film Screening	 Avon
260 Thayer Street
Providence, RI	 ,4pm	 	 Be A Man is a documentary feature film that follows comedian Ray Harrington on his journey to discover what it means to be a Modern Man before the birth of his son.
What does it mean to be a man? Comedian Ray Harrington has struggled with that question all of his life. Like many, he was raised by a single mother without any male influences to guide his awkward stumble into manhood. Now with a baby on the way, Ray realizes that before he can be a father, he needs to know what it means to be a man. Be A Man is a personal and heartwarming look at one manâs struggle to find his place in the world. Often laugh out loud funny, the film is wonderfully touching as Ray and his film crew welcome the viewer in as another friend on the journey of examining manliness and masculinity in modern culture.

Along the way, Ray asks for advice and help from fellow comedians and experts in their fields. Kyle Kinane, Bobby Kelly, Steve Rannazzisi, Doug Stanhope, and more all share their views on what it means to be a man. Ray steps into the ring to face 5 time world champion, Vinny Pazienza. Heâll also discover his signature drink, give himself a classic straight razor shave, hunt down his very rare dream car, and face a jury of women to find out if he can be the man that movies and television had always told him he should be.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

186 Carpenter
Providence, Rhode Island	 ,6:30-9:00 pm	 	 Everybodyâs Autobiography: A six-week prose workshop
During our six weeks together, we will engage in a rather unconventional exploration of what it means to write about a life, whether someone elseâs or oneâs own. We will read a number of biographical and autobiographical texts that play with questions of form and objectivity. And using ârealâ materials drawn from someoneâs lifeâbe it letters, journals, interview responses, voice recordings, etc.âwe will write our own, which later we will workshop during class. A willingness to engage closely with assigned readings and to experiment when working on oneâs own is expected. We should be ready to take risks, ready to put in the necessary work, and ready to enjoy the process.

The Manton Avenue Projectâs (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAPâs out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kidsâ voices to the stage.

âThis Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where weâve discussed the importance of public parks in our lives â what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods,â says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. âOur goal is to bring kidsâ voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrowâs creative thinkers and community leaders.â

This program is supported by the National Park Foundationâs âTicket to Rideâ program.

The Manton Avenue Projectâs 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://www.providenceonline.com

GENERAL STANTON INN FLEA MARKET SEEKS 50 NEW VENDORS IN CELEBRATION OF ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY	 The General Stanton Inn Flea Market
4115 Old Post Road
Charlestown, RI	 ,8 a.m.-4p.m. every
Saturday, Sunday and
Holiday Monday,
through Columbus Day	 	 In honor of its 50th Anniversary Season, organizers at  Charlestown's General Stanton Inn Flea Market, are hoping to add 50 new vendors to its ranks of sellers, who return season after season to market their wares at the outdoor, weekend Flea Market, from late April through mid-October.
The General Stanton Flea Market features booths selling antiques, collectibles, new and boutique items, crafts, art and Farmers' Market merchandise.  According to Janice Falcone, who has owned and operated both the Inn and the Flea Market since 1973, people selling local produce, plants, vegetables and other Farmers' Market items, have added a desired new dimension to the Flea Market during the last few seasons.

"Well, let's say they give us a "fresh" look, Falcone quips. "Tomato and basil plants, bright flowers, delicious mid-summer fruits and vegetables and  jams--they all seem quite at home among the wooden kitchen tools, hand-woven baskets and and all the other farmhouse antiques and collectibles sold here each week."

"We'd also like to see a wider variety of "home-grown" crafts for sale this year. On a peak Summer Sunday, we can get 1,000 to 2,000 folks out here browsing and buying-- and many of them are from different states and different countries.  Many are hoping to head home with something handmade from this area--a real souvenir from Rhode Island. Perhaps some of the on-line sellers around here, might want to take a break this summer and set up here. There's no better--or more fun-- place to spend some "face-time" than at a Flea Market!"

The octogenarian Ms. Falcone also hopes to attract a few more food trucks to Charlestown over the next six months.

"In past seasons, the aroma of that popping Kettle Korn and the puckering, refreshing taste of Del's Lemonade have added to the festive feel at our Flea Market. Yet to be able to grab a Greek salad or a fish taco here at the Flea Market, would be something else, altogether..."

10 x 20-feet booths are available at rates ranging from $20.-$35, depending on the location. Selling areas are available against the fence, on the grass and in pre-tarped rows. Vendors need to supply their own tables, chairs and sunbrellas, if they are not choosing a booth under the pre-tarped sections of the Market.  The Flea Market is set among the seven, tree-lined acres that make up the property of  the historic, General Joseph Stanton Inn, which was established in 1667.  It is one of the oldest inns in the country and was once a regular coach stop between Providence and New London.. It is located at 4115 Old Post Road in Charlestown, 02813.

The General Stanton Inn Flea Market also welcomes what Ms. Falcone refers to as "instant tag sales."

"We love our full-Season vendors, yet if you just want to set up your own, one-time, tag sale right here, we're fine with that. Why not take advantage of our built-in publicity and ever-expanding customer base, and clear out your cottage and garage of things someone else can use?"

Ms. Falcone is especially proud of the Flea Market's role in the  community.  All non-profit organizations are invited to set up sales and/or informational booths at the Flea Market on any weekend, free of charge.

"We're also Charlestown's 'cracker barrel,' where neighbors come to meet and greet and exchange town and beach news. I can't tell you how many times someone has stopped me while I'm buzzing around the market on my motorized cart, and asked me if I've seen 'so-and-so' that day.  And more often than not, I have."

The General Stanton Inn Flea Market is now open Saturdays, Sundays and Holiday Mondays through Columbus Day, 8 a.m.-4p.m.  (Since late April, it has been open on Sundays only.)

For further information or to reserve a vendor space, call Janice Falcone at 401-364-1818 or 401-364-8888.  http://www.generalstantoninn.com

HAO NI | Ghost Hit Wall	 Yellow Peril Gallery
60 Valley St #5
Providence, RI	 ,Opening: June 13,
6PM - 9PM	 	 Yellow Peril Gallery is pleased to present âGhost Hit Wallâ by Hao Ni, featuring an eclectic series of video, mixed media installations, sculptures, and drawings from June 11 â July 19, 2015. The opening reception is Saturday, June 13 from 6PM â 9PM.

âGhost Hit Wallâ is the literal translation of âé¬¼æçâ, the Mandarin Chinese expression of getting lost, going in a circle and not being able to get out. âThe idea is that when traveling in remote areas, a person is obstructed by walls that ghosts have placed in front of them, thus forcing that person to wander in endless circles,â says Ni. âPeople also use this term to describe problems with no real solution.â

The works featured in âGhost Hit Wallâ are infused with visual information that encourages viewers to contemplate what it is like to get lost in the various shapes, patterns, words and clues on display. Through organizing, manipulating, repeating, and translating everyday objects and scenarios, the exhibition excavates the different material layers in life to examine the tension, dread and uncertainty under the duress of continuously accelerating time.

The opening reception for âGhost Hit Wallâ is Saturday, June 13, from 6PM â 9PM. The exhibition will be on display until Sunday, July 19, 2015. This is Hao Niâs second solo exhibition at Yellow Peril Gallery. The first was âProximityâ in 2013.

About Hao NI
HAO NI was born in 1989 in Hsin Chu, Taiwan. He received his MFA in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2014. He has exhibited his work in group and solo shows in Providence, New York, Chicago, Miami, and Taipei, including venues like Taipei Fine Arts Museum in Taiwan, Queens Museum in New York, and New Bedford Art Museum in Massachusetts.

Providence International Arts Festival: The Earth Harp	 Greater Kennedy Plaza,2 Kennedy Plaza,Providence, RI 02903	 Jun 14, 2015  at 12:00 pm (Sun)


|	 Free	 The Earth Harp is the largest stringed instrument on the planet. Part sculpture, part instrument, and part architecture, the sound it creates is nothing short of remarkable. Together with one of the most unique and breathtaking ensembles in the world, the Earth Harp Collective, inventor William Close pushes the envelope of the musical experience – making beautiful music with a massive physics machine. The long golden strings will be played by Close running rosin-covered gloves along the instrument, creating beautiful, cello like tones. Turning the Earth/landscape into a giant harp, her strings have stretched 1,000 feet to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, temples in Vietnam and the Colosseum in Rome. In another “first work” for the Festival, the iconic Superman Building becomes part of the instrument for an extraordinary musical performance. Three-days of celebration, including community “plays” with local students from FirstWorks Arts Learning, culminate in Festival concerts on Saturday, June 13. The Earth Harp is part of the Providence International Arts Festival June 11-14 put on by FirstWorks & the City of Providence.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441914574/earth-harp-artist-logo-sidebar_medium.jpg

Fruit ices are popular in Europe, yet none is more loved than the product made from fresh lemon juice. Lemon ices produce the most delicious and thirst-quenching treat. Grandfather Franco DeLucia brought his father's frozen lemonade recipe to America at the turn of the century. Angelo DeLucia, his son, began work on a machine to produce the frozen lemonade, and on a method of making it a consistently excellent product. In 1948, Del's Frozen Lemonade acquired it's name and became the sole product sold at a little stand in Cranston, Rhode Island. Soon, Angelo had designed the first mobile units in order to serve anywhere in the state. When Angelo's son, Bruce, entered the family business there were 5 franchises in Rhode Island. Since then, Bruce has made the franchise business flourish and grow. Now, there are many Del's franchises worldwide providing the refreshing, all natural treat to everyone, anywhere, anytime.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/org/220185385/actnowri.com_foodtruck_delslemonade_medium.jpg

Beautiful - The Carole King Musical	 Providence Performing Arts Center,220 Weybosset Street,Providence, RI 02903	 September 15 - September 20, 2015	 $58 - &88	 Long before she was Carole King, chart-topping music legend, she was Carol Klein, Brooklyn girl with passion and chutzpah. She fought her way into the record business as a teenager and, by the time she reached her twenties, had the husband of her dreams and a flourishing career writing hits for the biggest acts in rock ‘n’ roll.  But it wasn’t until her personal life began to crack that she finally managed to find her true voice. BEAUTIFUL tells the inspiring true story of King’s remarkable rise to stardom, from being part of a hit songwriting team with her husband Gerry Goffin, to her relationship with fellow writers and best friends Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, to becoming one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history. Along the way, she made more than beautiful music, she wrote the soundtrack to a generation.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441880246/ck_medium.jpg

As cities and villages fell to the North, the few U.S. diplomats and military operatives who remained in the country contemplated withdrawal. With the lives of thousands of South Vietnamese hanging in the balance, those in control faced an impossible choice––who would go and who would be left behind to face brutality, imprisonment, or death.
Directed by Rory Kennedy, this Academy Award® nominated documentary premiers on PBS in April in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.

This language has been used throughout history by great authors, poets, and artists. In this workshop, we will explore some of the historic meanings; for example, bluebells stood for “kindness,” and rosemary was for “remembrance” and giving a red rose would declare “devotion.” After learning the secret language of flowers, each participant will create a "tussy mussy" and then fill it with a special flower message for a friend or family member.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/org/220142615/logo_medium.jpg

Jul 22, 2015  at 6:30 pm (Wed)	 $250.00 for 6-week course	 During our six weeks together, we will engage in a rather unconventional exploration of what it means to write about a life, whether someone else’s or one’s own. We will read a number of biographical and autobiographical texts that play with questions of form and objectivity. And using “real” materials drawn from someone’s life—be it letters, journals, interview responses, voice recordings, etc.—we will write our own, which later we will workshop during class. A willingness to engage closely with assigned readings and to experiment when working on one’s own is expected. We should be ready to take risks, ready to put in the necessary work, and ready to enjoy the process.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441920055/frequency_shopfront_medium.jpg

Providence International Arts Festival: The Earth Harp	 Greater Kennedy Plaza,2 Kennedy Plaza,Providence, RI 02903	 Jun 14, 2015  at 12:00 pm (Sun)


|	 Free	 The Earth Harp is the largest stringed instrument on the planet. Part sculpture, part instrument, and part architecture, the sound it creates is nothing short of remarkable. Together with one of the most unique and breathtaking ensembles in the world, the Earth Harp Collective, inventor William Close pushes the envelope of the musical experience – making beautiful music with a massive physics machine. The long golden strings will be played by Close running rosin-covered gloves along the instrument, creating beautiful, cello like tones. Turning the Earth/landscape into a giant harp, her strings have stretched 1,000 feet to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, temples in Vietnam and the Colosseum in Rome. In another “first work” for the Festival, the iconic Superman Building becomes part of the instrument for an extraordinary musical performance. Three-days of celebration, including community “plays” with local students from FirstWorks Arts Learning, culminate in Festival concerts on Saturday, June 13. The Earth Harp is part of the Providence International Arts Festival June 11-14 put on by FirstWorks & the City of Providence.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441914574/earth-harp-artist-logo-sidebar_medium.jpg

Shakespeare Under the Stars~ MuchAdo About Nothing	 Courthouse Center for the Arts,3481 Kingstown Rd.,West Kingston, RI 02892	 Jul 10, 2015  at 7:00 pm (Fri)	 $15	 Much Ado About Nothing is a comedic play by William Shakespeare thought to have been written in 1598 and 1599, as Shakespeare was approaching the middle of his career. The play was included in the First Folio, published in 1623. Much Ado About Nothing is generally considered one of Shakespeare's best comedies, because it combines elements of robust hilarity with more serious meditations on honor, shame, and court politics. By means of "noting" (which, in Shakespeare's day, sounded the same as "nothing," and which is gossip, rumour, and overhearing), Benedick and Beatrice are tricked into confessing their love for each other, and Claudio is tricked into rejecting Hero at the altar on the erroneous belief that she has been unfaithful. At the end, Benedick and Beatrice join forces to set things right, and the others join in a dance celebrating the marriages of the two couples.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441922726/much-ado-580x244_medium.jpg

James Montgomery	 Courthouse Center for the Arts,3481 Kingstown Rd.,West Kingston, RI 02892	 Jun 19, 2015  at 8:00 pm (Fri)	 $25	 When blues legend James Montgomery plays the harmonica, he "brings it on home". Whether it's recording with Kid Rock, sitting in with Gregg Allman, or fronting his hot band of thirty years, Montgomery plays with authority. While growing up in Detroit he learned first-hand from the masters - James Cotton, John Lee Hooker, and Jr. Wells - at the legendary "Chessmate." Over the years, he's carried on in the tradition and continues to be a vital presence in Blues as one of the most dynamic performers on the scene. "the John Mayall of New England" Peter Wolf In 1970, while attending Boston University, Montgomery formed the James Montgomery Band. His inimitable (oh yeah, he majored in English) harmonica playing combined with his incredibly energetic live shows led to the band's quick ascension on the New England music scene. Within two years, the James Montgomery band was among the hottest acts in Boston along with J. Geils and Aerosmith, and they were quickly signed to a multi-album deal with Capricorn Records. Since that time, James has recorded six albums. His first, "First Time Out" has been remastered and re-released by MRG/Capricorn. Other include "James Montgomery Band" on Island Records which was number nine on Billboard's national playlist, "Duck Fever" with members of the David Letterman Band, "Live Trax," with the Uptown Horns (the Rolling Stones' horn section), and his release on Tone-Cool, "The Oven Is On."	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/org/220159857/aa_medium.png

Jun 27, 2015  at 1:00 pm (Sat)	 Free	 From baby blankets and baby bottles to souped-up tricycles and baseballs, the work included in Dave Cole: American Lullaby summons images of an idyllic American childhood—at first glance. Fiberglass Teddy Bear (2004), an enormous stuffed pink bear visible through the windows of List Art Building, appears like a charmingly silly commemoration of youthful innocence. What, after all, is more emblematic of uncorrupted childhood than a teddy bear? Likewise, Baby Blanket (2002), a white swaddling cloth encased in a glass vitrine, sits like a perfectly preserved relic. However, close inspection of either of these objects quickly reveals how monstrous they actually are. Both are knit from materials laden with tiny shards of glass, making them abhorrent to the touch and dangerous to the lungs: the bear from Owens Corning Fiberglas (typically used for home insulation) and the blanket from Fiberfrax (an industrial porcelain developed to replace asbestos). Throughout his practice, Dave Cole juxtaposes such hazardous materials with the nostalgia of childhood to elucidate tensions between the ideal and the real.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441912930/dc_exhibition_01_medium.jpg

|	 Tuition:$420.00 | Lab Fee:$40.00	 This workshop in soapstone carving is designed to augment students' sculpting experience and expand their carving technique. Soapstone is the easiest of all stones to carve and offers the satisfying challenge of working in the round on an intimate scale. It is one of the best ways to learn reductive sculpture techniques and is suitable for beginners, yet the beauty of the stone and the finishes that can be achieved make it interesting for the more advanced student as well. Looking at the artwork of Native American carvers and some monumental modernist sculptors provides inspiration and focus for the wonderful, flowing forms students can achieve. Using saws, files, rasps and chisels, participants should be able to complete one small carving in three days. This is a wonderful opportunity for those who have never carved, and even for those who have. Please come with several ideas, sketches or visual references, if possible, so that we can begin carving immediately.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441922231/100_1085_medium.jpg

Illuminating the American Revolution: A Living History Event	 Colony House,Washington Square,Newport, RI 02840	 Jul 9, 2015  at 11:00 am (Thu)	 Free	 French troops arrived in Newport in July 1780 and occupied the city for nearly a year before marching south and helping Americans win the War for Independence. When they first set foot on Newport’s shore, many locals were wary and suspicious of the eminent arrival of a foreign force, so soon after the hostile British occupation. As a gesture of kindness, Newport officials organized an illumination, requiring residents to light candles in their windows at dusk to welcome their new allies. For those who could not afford candles, they were provided.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441921233/french_event_low_res_photo_medium.jpg

|	 FREE	 Yellow Peril Gallery is pleased to present “Ghost Hit Wall” by Hao Ni, featuring an eclectic series of video, mixed media installations, sculptures, and drawings.

“Ghost Hit Wall” is the literal translation of “???”, the Mandarin Chinese expression of getting lost, going in a circle and not being able to get out. “The idea is that when traveling in remote areas, a person is obstructed by walls that ghosts have placed in front of them, thus forcing that person to wander in endless circles,” says Ni. “People also use this term to describe problems with no real solution.”

The works featured in “Ghost Hit Wall” are infused with visual information that encourages viewers to contemplate what it is like to get lost in the various shapes, patterns, words and clues on display. Through organizing, manipulating, repeating, and translating everyday objects and scenarios, the exhibition excavates the different material layers in life to examine the tension, dread and uncertainty under the duress of continuously accelerating time.

This is Hao Ni’s second solo exhibition at Yellow Peril Gallery. The first was “Proximity” in 2013.

About Hao NI
HAO NI was born in 1989 in Hsin Chu, Taiwan. He received his MFA in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2014. He has exhibited his work in group and solo shows in Providence, New York, Chicago, Miami, and Taipei, including venues like Taipei Fine Arts Museum in Taiwan, Queens Museum in New York, and New Bedford Art Museum in Massachusetts.	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441917266/hao_250px2_medium.jpg

Jun 30, 2015  at 10:00 am (Tue)	 $10 Adults | $8 Seniors | $6 Students & Military | Free Members & Children Under 5	 Peter Marcus, retired professor of art at Washington University in St. Louis, won Best in Show for his magnificent collagraph, Grand Center, in the 2013 Newport Annual. Here, Marcus has turned his attention from architecture to family. He says, “In the past, members of any given family followed tradition and married within ‘their own kind.’ People rarely crossed religious, cultural, ethnic, or gender lines for marriage. Today American couples are blurring these lines and marrying whomever they want, leaving tradition behind. I have observed this not only in my community, but also through the lens of my own family. We, like so many Americans, have become part of ‘The New American Family.’”	 http://www.artsnowri.com/sites/artsnowri.com/images/event/441913163/marcus_alisonrobinjustine_740x428_medium.jpg

Keeping it simple with just four rockin’ instruments, and a big ol’ slice of velvety smooth vocals, these guys tear up a dance floor like a carpenter late for lunch. Whether they’re rippin’ thru a classic Louis Prima standard, or makin’ ya cry with a Nat King Cole ballad, the instruments grind along full throttle while the vocals float across the top as thick as a layer of gritty bar room smoke. Oh, they schwing baby and it ain’t for the faint at heart!

Potatoes (read his name real fast) started comedy by entering a bar comedy contest and defeating the fry cook, a magician and a homeless guy. Since that day, Pat has hasnt been able to stop performing, hitting over 500 stages in his 1st 2 years and gaining a rep as the "hardest woeking comic in New England. This hard work got him gigs as resident comic at 2 clubs (Jokers Wild in New haven CT and Comix at Foxwoods casino) Pat has worked with some big names (Jim Jefferies, Greg Giraldo, Gary Gulman, Shane Mauss, Susie Essman and Joe Piscopo to name a few) but is really starting to make a name for himself. Pat was selected to perform in the Granite State Comedy festival and won the R.I Comedy Connection Summer showdown.	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/55676c5abf1504.66052076-album_list_small.jpg

Corey Manning	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-07-10, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Take a seat and put you drinks/food in location where you're less likely to knock them over, because as soon as Corey Manning descends upon the stage... It's on!!!

If there is no energy in the room, he brings it. If there IS energy in the room, Corey absorbs it, electrifies it, and then takes it to another level.

Featured in season one of Nick Jr.’s NickMom Night Out Comedy Showcase, Corey was the Winner of the World Series of Comedy East Coast Regional Satellite Competition at Goodnights Comedy Club in July of 2011, and out of 101 comedians he finished in the Top Eight in the WSOC Finals in Las Vegas. With a resume that includes performances in Jamie Foxx's LAFFAPALOOZA's New Faces In Comedy, headlining comedy clubs nationally, and touring with comedians such as Mo'Nique, Tracey Morgan, Bill Burr, Damon Wayans, Lavell Crawford, John Witherspoon, Bill Bellamy, and Bonnie MacFarlane; Corey is known for his "Slick, upbeat, funny, over-the-top comedy."

Corey has yet to find an audience he can't entertain, or a topic he can't cover. From discussing culture, college life, being a NCP (non-custodial parent), the positives and negatives of social media, relationships and his experience with "Girls Night Out", Corey can cover the most challenging topics, in a tasteful and insightful way. Although there is usually no filter or safety net to Corey's performance, upon request he can provide entertainment that is appropriate and/or can be tailored to any audiences.

So if you're ready for a laugh of a life time, call Corey Manning to your rescue. He is your Comedian By Night. Superhero = By Day. Saving the world, one smile at a time.	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/53c81a50b58652.76901683-album_list_small.jpg

Ben Hague from The Rhode SHow & 92 ProFM	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-07-24, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Ben Hague is a stand up comedian, TV & radio personality, writer, and one of the hottest young talents on the comedy scene today. He is also the foremost aficionado of buffalo wings, and is an overall "good boy" according to his Nonnie.


At 21, after attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan, Ben moved to LA to pursue a career in comedy. He debuted his stand-up act at the world-famous comedy club Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, and never looked back. Since then he has been privileged to share the stage with such talents as Dane Cook, Dave Attel, Louis CK, Robert Klein, Jeffrey Ross, Gilbert Gottfried and many others.


Ben was a finalist in the Orange County "Laff Down" (2003) and Orange County "California's Funniest Person" two years running (2004, 2005). He won the "Catch A 'New' Rising Star" competition in his home state of Rhode Island in 2006. Ben has headlined at comedy clubs throughout the US, over 50 colleges nationally, and performed at the prestigious Fringe Festival in Scotland in 2011.


In 2009, Ben began his move into media by winning a hosting spot on FOX Providence's "The Rhode Show", beating out hundreds of other contestants. Ratings for the morning TV program immediately rose after he joined the team, and Ben became a staple on the show.


After his one year booking on "The Rhode Show" ended, he was immediately signed by the top morning radio show in New England, the "Giovanni and Kim Show" on 92.3 WPRO FM. The show is heard by over 300,000 listeners weekly. He also hosts many events and charities throughout the northeast, and of course is seen by thousands headlining on stages nationally. His debut recorded comedy album 'AVOID THE WET SPOT' is in the works for summer 2012. He currently lives in New York City and performs weekly at the top clubs in the city.


In his free time Ben enjoys all outdoor activities, is a huge new England sports fan, and can often be heard at bar's telling girls he wrote the screen plays for Mama Mia, and the Notebook.	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/536bbc08254e75.60816919-album_list_small.jpg
Whitesnake	 Twin River Event Center, 100 Twin River Road, Lincoln, RI, 02865,	 2015-07-24, 20:00:00,	 	 Whitesnake, the legendary rock’n’roll band founded and formed by Deep Purple singer David Coverdale are proud to announce their 2015 “The Purple Tour” which will feature their biggest hits & songs from the new tribute album. Having spent 2013 touring the world on the second leg of the Forevermore World Tour, 2014 was spent in the studio recording the 12th studio opus. Once again the hardcore fans are about to be surprised by the ‘Snake as they hit the road in 2015.

After leaving Deep Purple in 1976 Coverdale formed the original Whitesnake in 1978, and began a journey that has taken him from the early heavy blues rock of the late ‘70s with albums like ‘Trouble’, ‘Lovehunter’ ‘Ready And Willing’ and ‘Come An’ Get It’ through to the explosive hard rock of the revamped ‘Snake sound with the multi-platinum ‘Slide It In’ & 1987’s self-titled mega-million-selling smash-hit album. ‘Whitesnake’. See them live on Friday, July 24 at 8pm! Tickets start at $40 and are on sale now! All ages show.

Mike Finoia	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-07-31, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Mike Finoia of Milford never feels more alive, he says, than when he’s standing on a stage, exposing his deepest secrets to complete strangers, and they’re laughing. “Nothing can compare to it,” he says. “Nothing. And when it happened for the very first time, at Caroline’s in New York, well, it was an out-of-body experience.” Since that magic moment at Caroline’s, which came at the conclusion of a stand-up comedy class he completed in December of 2010, Finoia has performed in lots of places and made lots of people laugh at him and his secrets. According to his website, www.mikefinoia.com, he’s joked about everything from his “chicken-stealing great-grandfather to his ex-fiancee and his own father’s epic laziness.” He’s told his stories to everyone from the Gotham Comedy Club, the Cabaret at Mohegan Sun Casino, Comix at Foxwoods, to Joker’s Wild in New Haven. And plenty of other places besides. His goal, he says, is to sign every green room wall from Maine to San Diego. Now New Haveners who might have missed him at Joker’s Wild have a chance not only to see him perform this Saturday at Cafe Nine, but they can also have their own CD/DVD to enjoy the show again and again. He’s doing the DVDs to help take his career to the next level, hoping that people attending will pass it along to friends who will also like it. “I’m proud of this material,” he says, “and I want to record it. It’s a good snapshot of what I do. It may not ever end up on Comedy Central, but it’s capturing this moment.” Finoia, like a lot of comedians working today, started studying comedy from a very young age, long before he ever considered it a profession. He realized early on that making people laugh was a wonderful goal. He loves his grandfather, whom he describes as a “big, tough ironworker who could make any story into a funny one,” and his father, who has a dry wit that capitalizes on pop culture references. Finoia, 32, who was raised in North Haven in a big Italian family, says he watched “Saturday Night Live” and “Night at the Improv” with his parents from the time he was really very little. “I didn’t get all the jokes,” he says, “but I got the rhythm of comedy. I could feel the math of comedy, the set-up, set-up, punchline that meant it was time to laugh. Jerry Seinfeld could be telling a joke in Chinese, and yet we would know when to laugh.” Stand-up comedy was just an extension of what he said he’d really been doing all his life. “It feels a bit like being a little kid in the deep end of the pool,” he says. “You’re holding on, scared of drowning, and then you just let go — and you go under, but you bob back up to the top and you’re swimming. You’re OK. It’s a liberating moment.” The best moments are connecting the audience to those moments that everyone experiences, he says. “Everybody thinks about the quirky things in their lives, and to have someone onstage talk about those things — well, it sparks something in them. I want to have those connections.” His own favorite contemporary comedians are Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Patton Oswalt, and Paul F. Tompkins, yet he was influenced by Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin. “I can still remember laughing with my father, watching Steve Martin’s ‘Wild and Crazy Guy’ routine,” he says. In his own routines, he talks about the 17 years he spent following the band Phish, for instance, or the time he spent living in Oregon with Ken Kesey, the author of “One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” or how it was growing up in the 1980s before the Internet was fully operational. “When I went to college, they told me they were giving me an email address,” he says, “and I asked them where I should go to pick it up. My sisters and brothers, who are lots younger than I am, always had the Internet. They’re wired differently. In some ways, I have more in common with the cavemen than I have with them.” Finoia says preparing for an hour-long stand-up show is a lot like preparing a buffet meal. “I take a few of my experiences from all different parts of my life, a pinch of this, a little of this, and I prepare a plate for the audience. It’s a lot of fun.”	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/557b1c99718e85.42756390-album_list_small.jpg

Boz Scaggs	 Twin River Event Center, 100 Twin River Road, Lincoln, RI, 02865,	 2015-08-01, 20:00:00,	 	 Fans who have followed Scaggs’ remarkable career dating back to the late Sixties with the Steve Miller Band; his solo triumphs with such classic albums as Silk Degrees (1976) and Middle Man (1980); and the splendid assurance of late-period high points like Some Change (1994) and Dig (2001), will instantly recognize Scaggs’ characteristically deft touch as a singer. He brings a sly drawl to a funky workout like Li’l Millet and the Creoles’ “Rich Woman,” a conversational intimacy to Bobby Charles’s “Small Town Talk,” and an elegant delicacy to the Impressions’ “I’m So Proud.” His soul is effortless and deeply felt, never making a show of itself, but unmistakably evident in every lyric he delivers. See him live on Saturday, August 1 at 8pm! Tickets start at $35 and are on sale now! All ages show.	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/109/557b21ce953c00.91259613-album_list_small.jpg

Kyle Ploof from Sirius XM Radio.	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-08-14, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Kyle Ploof is a comedian from Boston who finds it weird and self-indulgent to write bios about himself in the third person.

I’m an aggressive guy from an aggressive city. I’m an honest person. I’m unhireable in everyday life. I hate hypocrites, but probably am one. I ask a lot of questions. Sometimes I’m high energy. Sometimes I’m low energy. Sometimes I’m happy. Sometimes I’m sad. I don’t have an on-stage “persona.” I’m not a wrestler– I’m a HUMAN BEING.

I have experiences with a variety people that I talk about in different places. Sometimes it makes those people angry. Sometimes it makes them happy. I don’t care. What’s most important to me is the laughter of strangers. (Healthy, right?)

Since my first awful set, I’ve done some things I never thought could happen. I got to tell jokes at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival, New York Comedy Expo, and the Bumbershoot Music & Arts Festival. I also got to work with some people I only saw on TV including: Robert Kelly (Tourgasm), Jim Norton (Opie & Anthony) and Ben Bailey (Host of Cash Cab.)

People generally find me relatable and funny (except for Mobile, Alabama and Reno, Nevada– they say I speak too fast.) Seeing me live will help me move out of my Mom’s quicker. You don’t want me to be a loser forever, do you?	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/551f0a402ce682.96489592-album_list_small.jpg

Wellesley Summer Theatre Company Presents: Three Sisters	 ,Wellesley College, 106 Central Street
Wellesley
MA
02481	 Thursday, May 21, 2015 7:00 pm
Sunday, June 21, 2015 2:00 pm	 $10.00 - $20.00	 May 21-June 21. Thursday, Friday, Saturday 7:00 PM. Saturday and Sunday 2:00 PM.
Three Sisters is Anton Chekhov's classic 1901 portrait of Russia's disappearing aristocratic class and their quest for meaning and fulfillment in the ever-changing modern world. Written in 1900 and first produced in 1901, Three Sisters was Chekhov's first specific commission for the Moscow Arts Theatre.
A year after the death of their father, an army officer, the Moscow-bred Prosorovs, including the three sisters Olga, Masha, Irina, and one brother Andrew, are finding life drab and increasingly hopeless in a provincial Russian town. Only the proximity of a nearby artillery post and the company of its officers make their existence bearable. Each of the sisters is in pursuit of love and happiness, but both of these desires seem increasingly out of reach as the play progresses.
The play has often been described as "the decline of the aristocratic and artistic elite coupled with the search for meaning in a modern world." Chekhov offers us the Prozorov siblings, who are refined and cultured youth, raised in Moscow but living a small and "lifeless" provincial town for the past eleven years. With the recent death of their father Colonel Prozorov, they await a return to Moscow where the "good life" can begin again.
From its initial success to current productions, audiences have responded with enthusiasm to this beautiful collision of envisioned dreams and frustrated hopes as well as the memorable characters of the Prozorov family and their friends, lovers, and acquaintances who populate the stage (
).
Wellesley Summer Theatre Company productions are $20 general admission, $10 seniors/students.

4:00 pm	   	 Sampson's Automotive, LLC is pleased to host their 3rd Annual "ANCHOR DOWN" European Car Show on June 14, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The annual extravaganza expects to showcase over 250 cars and motorcycles of all makes and models. Local food vendors, refreshments, live music, and over 50-raffle prizes promise excitement for the whole family. Admission is only $5 for walk-in spectators, with plenty of parking outside the show. Proceeds to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. Anchor Down features Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, and other European brand names. American muscle cars, antiques and motorcycles are expected to join in the fun. The event takes place at Sampson's Automotive, 342 Compass Circle in North Kingstown. Gates will open at 8 a.m. for those who want to showcase their vehicle. A fee of $15 for each car or motorcycle includes the driver and one passenger. Other passengers are asked to pay the $5 admission fee. Buddy's Hot Rod Dogs, Bravo Wood Fired, Del's Lemonade will be on hand with food and drink for over 2,500 attendees expected.
Brett Sampson, owner of Sampson's Auto, and his buddies grew up with a collective passion for cars. For years they attended four or more auto shows a year. At one point, many friends joined the armed forces and lost their camaraderie. Sampson kept thinking about all the fun they had, and dreamed of starting his own show. He found the Compass Circle property, and knew it would be a great venue. Sampson and his friends are all car enthusiasts. Launching the Anchor Down car show in 2013, they had 35 friends display their vehicles, with 77 in total. They combined their love of cars with their passion to help wounded veterans who return from deployment and need help. The first event raised $890, and donations more than tripled the following year.
All are invited to come enjoy an awesome day of fund¬raising for an important cause.

Sacred Firewalking Walk through life fearlessly...	 Sisters of Solace,700 American Legion Hwy
Westport
MA
02790	 Saturday, July 18, 2015 5:00 pm
10:00 pm	 $175.00	 Sacred Firewalking is a 5-hour transformational event designed to help you learn to walk through your life fearlessly. By learning how to walk on fire--literally.
Firewalking is an ancient sacred practice that has been present for centuries in cultures all around the world; with the oldest recorded firewalk occurring 4000 years ago.
The practice of firewalking is a powerful life-changing experience for self-realization and empowerment. It is direct physical proof of the mind-body connection that must be experienced to be truly understood.
During this life-changing experiential event you will learn to walk across hot coals and...
* Overcome fears
* Honor your intuition
* Release limiting beliefs
* Trust your internal guidance
* Shift from fear to confidence
* Discover that you are more powerful than you realized
Firewalking is entirely optional. Even if you chose not to firewalk, it is profoundly transformational to watch others cross the coals without being burned.	 http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/syNZt8kYeEmAPrhsosbP-g/ml.jpg

Providence
RI
02903	 Saturday, August 22, 2015 6:30 pm	 Free	 (Providence, RI) The Manton Avenue Project (MAP) is proud to announce that plays from their most recent festival, "This Land is Our Land: the public park plays," will be presented in a summer series as part of the 50th anniversary of the Roger Williams National Memorial.
Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. "This Land Is Our land" was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!
The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage.
"This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods," says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. "Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders."
This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's "Ticket to Ride" program.
The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/H1tnsLls7c6hOzZHGN1N2g/ml.jpg

Montgomery Gentry at Indian Ranch	 Indian Ranch,Rt 16
Webster
MA
01570	 Saturday, July 11, 2015 2:00 pm	 $24.50 - $56.50	 Indian Ranch is excited to have Montgomery Gentry at Indian Ranch, Saturday July 11 at 2:00 pm as part of their summer concert series. Tickets are on-sale at
now!
When the two Kentucky boys--Eddie, is from Lancaster and Troy is from Lexington--first burst onto the national scene in 1999 with the defiant "Hillbilly Shoes" notice was served--country music had never seen a hard driving duo like this.
Despite the millions of albums sold, the sold out shows and the scores of awards, Montgomery Gentry remains in touch with its working class roots. "We are blue collar workers and we lived the songs that we sing," says Troy. "Because of that, our fans are able to make the connection and when they hear our songs, they know we are singing with passion and we know what we are talking about."
"Unlike other awards, becoming members of the Grand Ole Opry is something people can't take away from you," Troy says. "Other awards come and go, but once you become a member of the Opry, you are a member for life--that's something that Eddie and I are very proud to be a part of."
There's no doubt that they're hard-running honky tonkers, but Eddie and Troy are also empathetic citizens of the world. Acknowledged by the Academy of Country Music as the 2010 winners of its Humanitarian Award, they devote their time and energy into making the needs of others a priority. They are active participants in many charitable organizations, including the U.S. military and numerous charitable organizations such as the TJ Martell Foundation, Camp Horsin' Around and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Middle Tennessee, among numerous others.
Make no mistake about it: Montgomery Gentry has secured a place in musical history with a unique blend of country, southern rock and Everly Brothers-like harmonies combined with relatable lyrics. This is especially evident with their latest radio release, "Headlights", from the highly anticipated album slated to be released in early 2015. With infectious lyrics and an anthem feel, this latest offering from the duo will have fans partying on tailgates well into the future.

manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial	 Roger Williams National Memorial,282 N Main St
Providence
RI
02903	 Saturday, June 20, 2015 6:30 pm	 Free	 (Providence, RI) The Manton Avenue Project (MAP) is proud to announce that plays from their most recent festival, "This Land is Our Land: the public park plays," will be presented in a summer series as part of the 50th anniversary of the Roger Williams National Memorial. Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. "This Land Is Our land" was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!
The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage.
"This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods," says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. "Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders."
This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's "Ticket to Ride" program.
The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/57wTzk-wFbsTJu-4in0aUg/ml.jpg

02038	 Today, June 14, 2015 8:00 am
12:00 pm	 $10.00 - $35.00	 PMC Kids Rides became an official PMC program in 2005 as a way to include young cyclists in the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge mission raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. The program engages youth in philanthropy, instills the value of working for the benefit of others, and promotes athletic fitness and physical activity.
The PMC Kids Rides Program offers children, parents, and neighbors an opportunity to work together to create individual bike-a-thons in neighborhoods, at schools, or in business complexes. These rides enable children between the ages of 3 and 15 to ride their bikes and solicit sponsors to donate money to cancer research.
The PMC Kids Ride gives us the opportunity to work together with the Franklin community and make a significant impact in the fight against cancer. We have all been touched in some way with someone who has had cancer. This ride gives children an opportunity to feel that they can make a difference. It empowers kids to become part of the Pan Mass Challenge (PMC) mission of raising money for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. This ride also teaches children the value of riding for the benefit of others.
Registration fee: $10
Required fundraising minimum: $25
Last year, our ride raised over $43,000 and this year, our goal is $50,000. Please help us reach this goal.
Here are some ways you can help us:
1.  Make a Direct Donation
2. Sign up for our Ride:

With little fanfare, 'Redneck Crazy" was a #2 Billboard Country Album debut and an even more impressive Top 5 Billboard Top 200 Album debut.

manton avenue project summer series at roger williams national memorial	 Roger Williams National Memorial,282 N Main St
Providence
RI
02903	 Saturday, July 11, 2015 6:30 pm	 Free	 (Providence, RI) The Manton Avenue Project (MAP) is proud to announce that plays from their most recent festival, "This Land is Our Land: the public park plays," will be presented in a summer series as part of the 50th anniversary of the Roger Williams National Memorial. Performances will take place on several Saturdays starting in June: June 20th, July 11th, July 25th, August 8th, and August 22nd at 6:30pm. "This Land Is Our land" was a culminating festival of short plays written by young people in our program for first time playwrights -- ten third-graders at William D'Abate Elementary School. For this program, The Manton Avenue Project partnered with the Roger Williams National Memorial. Now MAP will bring the plays to the park!
The Manton Avenue Project's (MAP) mission is to nurture the unique potential of kids living in Olneyville by unleashing their creative voices and uniting them with professional artists to create original theatre. Each of MAP's out-of-school time programs is focused on playwriting education, mentorship, and bringing kids' voices to the stage.
"This Summer Series will be a culmination of an enriching afterschool class, where we've discussed the importance of public parks in our lives - what we do in parks with our families and friends, and how parks create community, memorialize and recognize history, and create better futures for our neighborhoods," says Executive/Artistic Director Meg Sullivan. "Our goal is to bring kids' voices to the public stage, valuing their creative voices, and through our ongoing and tuition-free playwriting programs, helping them reach their full potential as tomorrow's creative thinkers and community leaders."
This program is supported by the National Park Foundation's "Ticket to Ride" program.
The Manton Avenue Project's 2014-15 season and programs, are also supported by The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, a Citizens Bank Growing Communities grant, a Senate Legislative Grant from the State of Rhode Island, a grant from the Katherine Baker Charitable Trust, The United Way of RI, as well as many other individual and corporate donors.	 http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/ephoto/kuVxS6aew2hHp2LJBxT85w/ml.jpg
