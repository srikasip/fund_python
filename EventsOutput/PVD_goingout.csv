Ben Hague from The Rhode SHow & 92 ProFM	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-07-24, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Ben Hague is a stand up comedian, TV & radio personality, writer, and one of the hottest young talents on the comedy scene today. He is also the foremost aficionado of buffalo wings, and is an overall "good boy" according to his Nonnie.


At 21, after attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan, Ben moved to LA to pursue a career in comedy. He debuted his stand-up act at the world-famous comedy club Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, and never looked back. Since then he has been privileged to share the stage with such talents as Dane Cook, Dave Attel, Louis CK, Robert Klein, Jeffrey Ross, Gilbert Gottfried and many others.


Ben was a finalist in the Orange County "Laff Down" (2003) and Orange County "California's Funniest Person" two years running (2004, 2005). He won the "Catch A 'New' Rising Star" competition in his home state of Rhode Island in 2006. Ben has headlined at comedy clubs throughout the US, over 50 colleges nationally, and performed at the prestigious Fringe Festival in Scotland in 2011.


In 2009, Ben began his move into media by winning a hosting spot on FOX Providence's "The Rhode Show", beating out hundreds of other contestants. Ratings for the morning TV program immediately rose after he joined the team, and Ben became a staple on the show.


After his one year booking on "The Rhode Show" ended, he was immediately signed by the top morning radio show in New England, the "Giovanni and Kim Show" on 92.3 WPRO FM. The show is heard by over 300,000 listeners weekly. He also hosts many events and charities throughout the northeast, and of course is seen by thousands headlining on stages nationally. His debut recorded comedy album 'AVOID THE WET SPOT' is in the works for summer 2012. He currently lives in New York City and performs weekly at the top clubs in the city.


In his free time Ben enjoys all outdoor activities, is a huge new England sports fan, and can often be heard at bar's telling girls he wrote the screen plays for Mama Mia, and the Notebook.	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/536bbc08254e75.60816919-album_list_small.jpg

Once again the hardcore fans are about to be surprised by the ‘Snake as they hit the road in 2015.

After leaving Deep Purple in 1976 Coverdale formed the original Whitesnake in 1978, and began a journey that has taken him from the early heavy blues rock of the late ‘70s with albums like ‘Trouble’, ‘Lovehunter’ ‘Ready And Willing’ and ‘Come An’ Get It’ through to the explosive hard rock of the revamped ‘Snake sound with the multi-platinum ‘Slide It In’ & 1987’s self-titled mega-million-selling smash-hit album. ‘Whitesnake’.

Mike Finoia	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-07-31, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Mike Finoia of Milford never feels more alive, he says, than when he’s standing on a stage, exposing his deepest secrets to complete strangers, and they’re laughing. “Nothing can compare to it,” he says. “Nothing. And when it happened for the very first time, at Caroline’s in New York, well, it was an out-of-body experience.” Since that magic moment at Caroline’s, which came at the conclusion of a stand-up comedy class he completed in December of 2010, Finoia has performed in lots of places and made lots of people laugh at him and his secrets. According to his website, www.mikefinoia.com, he’s joked about everything from his “chicken-stealing great-grandfather to his ex-fiancee and his own father’s epic laziness.” He’s told his stories to everyone from the Gotham Comedy Club, the Cabaret at Mohegan Sun Casino, Comix at Foxwoods, to Joker’s Wild in New Haven. And plenty of other places besides. His goal, he says, is to sign every green room wall from Maine to San Diego. Now New Haveners who might have missed him at Joker’s Wild have a chance not only to see him perform this Saturday at Cafe Nine, but they can also have their own CD/DVD to enjoy the show again and again. He’s doing the DVDs to help take his career to the next level, hoping that people attending will pass it along to friends who will also like it. “I’m proud of this material,” he says, “and I want to record it. It’s a good snapshot of what I do. It may not ever end up on Comedy Central, but it’s capturing this moment.” Finoia, like a lot of comedians working today, started studying comedy from a very young age, long before he ever considered it a profession. He realized early on that making people laugh was a wonderful goal. He loves his grandfather, whom he describes as a “big, tough ironworker who could make any story into a funny one,” and his father, who has a dry wit that capitalizes on pop culture references. Finoia, 32, who was raised in North Haven in a big Italian family, says he watched “Saturday Night Live” and “Night at the Improv” with his parents from the time he was really very little. “I didn’t get all the jokes,” he says, “but I got the rhythm of comedy. I could feel the math of comedy, the set-up, set-up, punchline that meant it was time to laugh. Jerry Seinfeld could be telling a joke in Chinese, and yet we would know when to laugh.” Stand-up comedy was just an extension of what he said he’d really been doing all his life. “It feels a bit like being a little kid in the deep end of the pool,” he says. “You’re holding on, scared of drowning, and then you just let go — and you go under, but you bob back up to the top and you’re swimming. You’re OK. It’s a liberating moment.” The best moments are connecting the audience to those moments that everyone experiences, he says. “Everybody thinks about the quirky things in their lives, and to have someone onstage talk about those things — well, it sparks something in them. I want to have those connections.” His own favorite contemporary comedians are Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Patton Oswalt, and Paul F. Tompkins, yet he was influenced by Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin. “I can still remember laughing with my father, watching Steve Martin’s ‘Wild and Crazy Guy’ routine,” he says. In his own routines, he talks about the 17 years he spent following the band Phish, for instance, or the time he spent living in Oregon with Ken Kesey, the author of “One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” or how it was growing up in the 1980s before the Internet was fully operational. “When I went to college, they told me they were giving me an email address,” he says, “and I asked them where I should go to pick it up. My sisters and brothers, who are lots younger than I am, always had the Internet. They’re wired differently. In some ways, I have more in common with the cavemen than I have with them.” Finoia says preparing for an hour-long stand-up show is a lot like preparing a buffet meal. “I take a few of my experiences from all different parts of my life, a pinch of this, a little of this, and I prepare a plate for the audience. It’s a lot of fun.”	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/557b1c99718e85.42756390-album_list_small.jpg

Boz Scaggs	 Twin River Event Center, 100 Twin River Road, Lincoln, RI, 02865,	 2015-08-01, 20:00:00,	 	 Fans who have followed Scaggs’ remarkable career dating back to the late Sixties with the Steve Miller Band; his solo triumphs with such classic albums as Silk Degrees (1976) and Middle Man (1980); and the splendid assurance of late-period high points like Some Change (1994) and Dig (2001), will instantly recognize Scaggs’ characteristically deft touch as a singer. He brings a sly drawl to a funky workout like Li’l Millet and the Creoles’ “Rich Woman,” a conversational intimacy to Bobby Charles’s “Small Town Talk,” and an elegant delicacy to the Impressions’ “I’m So Proud.” His soul is effortless and deeply felt, never making a show of itself, but unmistakably evident in every lyric he delivers. See him live on Saturday, August 1 at 8pm! Tickets start at $35 and are on sale now! All ages show.	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/109/557b21ce953c00.91259613-album_list_small.jpg

It may not ever end up on Comedy Central, but it’s capturing this moment.” Finoia, like a lot of comedians working today, started studying comedy from a very young age, long before he ever considered it a profession. He realized early on that making people laugh was a wonderful goal. He loves his grandfather, whom he describes as a “big, tough ironworker who could make any story into a funny one,” and his father, who has a dry wit that capitalizes on pop culture references. Finoia, 32, who was raised in North Haven in a big Italian family, says he watched “Saturday Night Live” and “Night at the Improv” with his parents from the time he was really very little. “I didn’t get all the jokes,” he says, “but I got the rhythm of comedy. I could feel the math of comedy, the set-up, set-up, punchline that meant it was time to laugh. Jerry Seinfeld could be telling a joke in Chinese, and yet we would know when to laugh.” Stand-up comedy was just an extension of what he said he’d really been doing all his life. “It feels a bit like being a little kid in the deep end of the pool,” he says. “You’re holding on, scared of drowning, and then you just let go — and you go under, but you bob back up to the top and you’re swimming. You’re OK. It’s a liberating moment.” The best moments are connecting the audience to those moments that everyone experiences, he says. “Everybody thinks about the quirky things in their lives, and to have someone onstage talk about those things — well, it sparks something in them. I want to have those connections.” His own favorite contemporary comedians are Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Patton Oswalt, and Paul F. Tompkins, yet he was influenced by Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin. “I can still remember laughing with my father, watching Steve Martin’s ‘Wild and Crazy Guy’ routine,” he says. In his own routines, he talks about the 17 years he spent following the band Phish, for instance, or the time he spent living in Oregon with Ken Kesey, the author of “One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” or how it was growing up in the 1980s before the Internet was fully operational. “When I went to college, they told me they were giving me an email address,” he says, “and I asked them where I should go to pick it up. My sisters and brothers, who are lots younger than I am, always had the Internet. They’re wired differently. In some ways, I have more in common with the cavemen than I have with them.” Finoia says preparing for an hour-long stand-up show is a lot like preparing a buffet meal. “I take a few of my experiences from all different parts of my life, a pinch of this, a little of this, and I prepare a plate for the audience. It’s a lot of fun.”	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/557b1c99718e85.42756390-album_list_small.jpg

Kyle Ploof from Sirius XM Radio.	 Comedy Connection, 39 Warren Avenue, East Providence, RI, 02914,	 2015-08-14, 20:00:00, 22:00:00,	 	 Kyle Ploof is a comedian from Boston who finds it weird and self-indulgent to write bios about himself in the third person.

I’m an aggressive guy from an aggressive city. I’m an honest person. I’m unhireable in everyday life. I hate hypocrites, but probably am one. I ask a lot of questions. Sometimes I’m high energy. Sometimes I’m low energy. Sometimes I’m happy. Sometimes I’m sad. I don’t have an on-stage “persona.” I’m not a wrestler– I’m a HUMAN BEING.

I have experiences with a variety people that I talk about in different places. Sometimes it makes those people angry. Sometimes it makes them happy. I don’t care. What’s most important to me is the laughter of strangers. (Healthy, right?)

Since my first awful set, I’ve done some things I never thought could happen. I got to tell jokes at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival, New York Comedy Expo, and the Bumbershoot Music & Arts Festival. I also got to work with some people I only saw on TV including: Robert Kelly (Tourgasm), Jim Norton (Opie & Anthony) and Ben Bailey (Host of Cash Cab.)

People generally find me relatable and funny (except for Mobile, Alabama and Reno, Nevada– they say I speak too fast.) Seeing me live will help me move out of my Mom’s quicker. You don’t want me to be a loser forever, do you?	 https://goingout.com/venue_data/ri/75/551f0a402ce682.96489592-album_list_small.jpg
