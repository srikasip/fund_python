As cities and villages fell to the North, the few U.S. diplomats and military operatives who remained in the country contemplated withdrawal. With the lives of thousands of South Vietnamese hanging in the balance, those in control faced an impossible choice––who would go and who would be left behind to face brutality, imprisonment, or death.
Directed by Rory Kennedy, this Academy Award® nominated documentary premiers on PBS in April in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.
